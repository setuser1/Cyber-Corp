Its been a whirlwind year for the vibe-coding worlds database of choice: Supabase. On Friday, Supabase announced that it raised a fresh $100 million Series E at a $5 billion valuation, led by Accel and Peak XV. This is just four months after closing its $200 million Series D at a $2 billion valuation, led by Accel.

And that Series D was just seven months after raising an $80 million Series C led by Sequoia spinoff Peak XV and David Sacks Craft Ventures at an undisclosed valuation. PitchBook estimated Supabase was valued at around $765 million in that deal, post-money.
