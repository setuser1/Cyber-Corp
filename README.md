Cooking is all about timing, right? So if youre a home chef looking for an opportunity to save money on new kitchen gear, your deals timer should be pinging right about now. Amazons October Prime Day sale has extended to lots of the kitchen appliances and gadgets that Engadget staffers use and recommend. We found deals on Ninja air fryers, Anova sous vide machines, Breville appliances, KitchenAid gadgets and many more. Here are the best Prime Day deals on kitchen tech we could find — along with links to our reviews and guides so you can make informed (and timely) purchases.

The best Prime Day kitchen deals

Cosori

Cosori 9-in-1 TurboBlaze Air Fryer 6 Qt

$90$120Save $30

This is the runner up pick in our air fryer buying guide. We appreciate the roomy basket and easy-to-use touchscreen. Its missing the clear front window that our top pick from Instant has but, unlike that one, the Cosori has a release button on the basket which is a welcome safety feature.

$90 at Amazon

Ninja Creami ice cream maker with extra pints $200 ($55 off with Prime): Here's a bundle that includes two additional pint jars for the ice cream maker. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen tech and we called it a frozen fantasy-maker in our review. Note that the unit itself dipped down to $160 last Black Friday and the extra pints have gone as low as $16.

Hamilton Beach Digital Rice Cooker for $37 ($13 off): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is great for small kitchens (but probably not for big families). We thought it outperformed other cookers that are four times the price, though its not the best for all-day warming of rice as the bottom bigs got a little overdone.

Instant Pot Vortex Plus with Clear Cook for $80 ($20 off with Prime): This Vortex air fryer model is similar to our top airfryer pick, but is missing the Odor Ease feature. It still has the Clear Cook window that lets you keep an eye on your food as it crisps and the Vortex cooking tech heats up remarkably fast, with almost no pre-heating time.

Instant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 ($65 off): Heres a smaller version of our best overall air fryer. This one has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly thanks to a 1600-watt output.

Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesnt take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen.

Breville InFizz Fusion beverage maker for $200 ($50 off): We called this fizz-maker the bubble master in our review. True, its pricier than rivals in the same space, but the upscale design — that actually looks good on a countertop — somewhat makes up for the price premium. We also appreciate the Fusion Cap that helps prevent messy eruptions when youre bubbling up your drinks.

Cosori Air Fryer Pro Compact for $85 ($15 off with Prime): One of our concerns with the Cosori 9-in-1 was that it was a little on the wide side, taking up extra countertop space. The Pro Compact has a more space-saving design while still packing a five-quart basket.

Instant Pot 4QT Vortex mini air fryer for $55 ($35 off with Prime): This models four-quart capacity falls between our top Instant Pot air fryer pick and the budget model. It has the Clear Cook window feature, six presets and it comes in pink in addition to the standard white and black.

Instant Pot Duo Plus for $90 ($50 off): We named this the best multicooker in our guide to the best kitchen tech weve tested. It can cook a dizzying array of foods from basic beans and rice to homemade yogurt. We like this one because its simple to use, and has quick-cooking modes for soup, eggs and grains. Theres even a sous vide cooking function.

Breville Bambino Plus for $400 ($100 off): In our gift guide for coffee lovers, this espresso machine earned our respect for its compact size and the fact that it doesnt cost a grand, like some machines do. Plus the controls are easy for beginners to learn but makes silky milkfoam for pro-level latte artists.

Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $130 ($20 off): This went as low as $110 back in January, but its still a decent discount on a high-powered juice extractor. We were won over by its impressive juicing abilities and despite how it looks, it's surprisingly easy to clean — as long as you do it right away.

Ninja Dual Foodie Zone Air Fryer (DZ302) for $180 ($50 off): If you want to air fry two different things at the same time, this is the one to get. This is the same in specs, capacity and wattage as our top pick for a dual-zone air fryer, just with a different model number. It even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time. Note the price was $20 lower for Prime members back in July.

Ninja 5.5-quart Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) for $130 ($50 off): This one earned an honorable mention in our guide to air fryers. Its double the capacity of our budget pick and has a dehydrate preset. While we found the round basket a little cramped, we liked how the fryers vertical design saved counter space. Just note that this went as low as $90 in July.
