OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Monday announced the launch of AgentKit, a toolkit for building and deploying AI agents, at the firms Dev Day event.

“AgentKit is a complete set of building blocks available in the open AI platform designed to help you take agents from prototype to production. It is everything you need to build, deploy, and optimize agent workflows with way less friction,” Altman said.
