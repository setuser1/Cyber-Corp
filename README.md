OpenAI reportedly asked the Raine family — whose 16-year-old son Adam Raine died by suicide after prolonged conversations with ChatGPT — for a full list of attendees from the teenagers memorial, signaling that the AI firm may try to subpoena friends and family.

OpenAI also requested “all documents relating to memorial services or events in the honor of the decedent, including but not limited to any videos or photographs taken, or eulogies given,” per a document obtained by the Financial Times.
