When Apple announced its thin and light iPhone Air, some people said, &#8220;Who asked for a thinner phone?&#8221; Moments later, the company went in the other direction and announced a slightly thicker and bulkier iPhone 17 Pro lineup.

With this, Apple did what those people had wanted: It made a phone with a thicker form factor to accommodate a larger battery, leading to better performance. Out of the new iPhones, the Pro phones received more iterative updates (unless you count the new orange color). But people who buy these phones will still reap the benefits.

The build

The first thing that youll notice with the iPhone 17 Pro is the new unibody build with aluminum, alongside a new camera bump design on the back with space for MagSafe-based accessories below it. Ive gotten used to cross-body camera bumps like the one on the Pixel 10, so I dont mind the new design choice from Apple.
