It's promising 'fashion-forward eyewear that blends cutting-edge AI-native technology' coming next year.

As part of its Galaxy XR headset presentation, Samsung also briefly teased another wearable product. It's working in collaboration with two eyewear companies, Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, on AI-powered smart glasses to go up against Meta's Ray-Ban models, Samsung's head of customer experience Jay Kim announced at the end of the livestream.

"We're also really excited about the AI glasses that we're currently building together with Google," Kim said. "We're working with two of the most forward-thinking brands in eyewear, Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, to introduce new devices that fit into your lifestyle."

Samsung will focus on two different markets with those brands, though both will include "cutting-edge" AI features co-developed with Google. With Gentle Monster, it's developing "fashion-forward" glasses that will likely be aimed at the higher end of the market. The Warby Parker collaboration, meanwhile, will yield eyewear designed for general consumers, probably at a lower price point.

Samsung only said that the AI glasses will bring "style, comfort and practicality" to everyday life via Android's XR ecosystem. As we saw in May with Google's prototype XR smart glasses, it will likely employ a Gemini-powered display that will show notifications and small snippets of info from your apps, like the music you're listening to or turn-by-turn GPS directions. It should also have a built-in camera, of course, along with speakers and a microphone.

Design and appearance will also be key, but Samsung has yet to show any images of the upcoming smart glasses and didn't reveal a release date. However, it will have a tough climb against Meta's lineup given the Ray-Ban branding and that company's head start on the technology. Last week, Meta introduced its Ray-Ban Display model that includes a screen for a true extended reality experience.
