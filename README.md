With October Prime Day comes deals on all sorts of things, including tech and toys. Amazon has used the event to kickstart the holiday shopping season for the past few years, making it a good time to pick up early gifts for less and stock up on things for yourself without spending full price. Maybe you havent even thought about the holidays yet, but its worth giving the latest Prime Day Lego deals a look. A number of Lego sets from the Super Mario and Star Wars collections are already on sale for up to 38 percent off.

When shopping for Lego sets on Amazon, we highly recommend checking a price tracker like Keepa or CamelCamelCamel before buying. It's not difficult to find Lego sets "on sale" at Amazon, but often those discounted prices have been around for a long time. We've clocked "deals" in which the sale price has been available for months already, going back as far as late spring and early summer 2025. Here, we're mostly highlighting discounts on new Lego sets, recent price drops and record-low (and close to them) prices on popular Lego sets from franchises like Star Wars, Super Mario and others.
