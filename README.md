South Korea is nearing a decision on whether to allow Google and Apple to export high-resolution geographic map data to servers outside the country. The detailed maps, which use a 1:5,000 scale, would show streets, buildings, and alleyways in far greater detail than currently available on these platforms. However, several regulatory and security hurdles remain unresolved.

Earlier this week, South Koreas National Assembly Defense Committee held a parliamentary audit of Google Korea. Lawmakers questioned the companys requests for local map data, raising concerns over national security and digital sovereignty. The session comes two months after Seoul postponed its decision on Googles request to export high-resolution map data in August, following an earlier delay in May.
