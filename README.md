If Hollywood has taught us anything, it's that a blockbuster that makes bank will get a sequel (or seven). Enter A Minecraft Movie, with its surprisingly effective humor and $957 million box office payday. (Who had "Jack Black will anchor a nearly billion-dollar movie" on their 2025 bingo card?) So, it's no surprise that Warner Bros. has officially greenlit a sequel.

Variety reports that Warner Bros. has penciled in the sequel for a July 23, 2027, premiere date. That would place it around two years after the original, which is the second-highest-grossing film of the year so far. (Disney's Lilo & Stitch is in first, with a cool $1.03 billion at the box office.)

The sequel will reportedly bring back director Jared Hess. The Napoleon Dynamite creator will also co-write the screenplay with Chris Galletta. Producers are said to include Mary Parent, Cale Boyter, Roy Lee, Eric McLeod, Kayleen Walters, Torfi Frans Ã“lafsson and Jason Momoa.

Engadget was among the many publications taken aback by how good A Minecraft Movie was. After all, a film about an open-ended building game, starring one of the leads of the crummy Borderlands, didn't sound promising. But we found it surprisingly funny, with just the right degree of winking self-awareness. On top of that, Devindra Hardawar said it "delivers a decent message about championing creativity in a world that wants to beat down free-thinking non-conformists." Amen to that.
