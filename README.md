Crashout Crew looks like Overcooked-style mayhem from one of the studios behind Peak

A demo for this chaotic co-op game will go live during Steam Next Fest this month.

Crashout Crew

(Aggro Crab)

It's been quite the year for Aggro Crab. After stopping production on a sequel to Going Under (with funding issues and burnout both factoring into that decision), the studio decided to focus on self-funded game jam projects before moving onto another big game. Some of the team collaborated with Content Warning developer Landfall to create Peak. With the help of clever marketing, that co-op climbing game turned out to be a huge hit, selling 10 million copies in just two months.

The rest of the Aggro Crab squad focused on a different multiplayer game, which is called Crashout Crew. This is a party game for up to four players (there's a single-player option too) in which you'll try to complete orders in hazard-filled warehouses using cute, color-coded forklifts. Time is of the essence as you race to meet quotas by loading boxes into trucks, so its just as well that you can drift around corners. Just be careful not to drop any explosives.

Youll be skidding around icy environments and spinning out if you run over a broken egg. Falling rocks, bees and blackouts all add to the chaos. You can upgrade your forklift and warehouse, though theyll reset after the level ends.

The reveal trailer reminds me quite a bit of Overcooked. I wonder if this could turn out to be just as effective as a litmus test for how well you communicate with family and friends.

I adore Another Crab's Treasure, Aggro Crabs last large-scale game, so I'll always be interested in whatever the studio is cooking up. I'm looking forward to trying out Crashout Crew when the demo goes live on October 13 as part of Steam Next Fest. The game is scheduled to hit Steam next year.
