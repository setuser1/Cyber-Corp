Instagram Threads, Metas X rival that now has over 400 million monthly active users, is officially launching a new feature that could redefine how its app is used: Communities. On Thursday, Meta said its introducing over 100 communities to the app, where users worldwide can have casual conversations around topics like basketball, television, K-pop, books, and more.

The idea, explains Meta, is to give users dedicated spaces within the app where they can delve deeper into conversations on topics that matter to them. The communities users have joined will display on their Threads profile, and each community has its own custom &#8220;Like&#8221; emoji available to members who engage with the discussions.

While the concept, on the surface, sounds similar to Xs Communities, there are key differences between the two implementations.
