Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri and Snap CEO Evan Spiegel will have to testify in an upcoming trial that deals with social media safety and whether the executives' platforms are addictive. A Los Angeles judge ruled that the three men will need to testify in the trial set to begin in January, according to CNBC.

"The testimony of a CEO is uniquely relevant, as that officers knowledge of harms, and failure to take available steps to avoid such harms could establish negligence or ratification of negligent conduct,‚Äù Judge Carolyn B. Kuhl wrote. As CNBC points out, the January trial will be closely watched as it's the first of many lawsuits alleging harms to young social media users that will head to trial.

Lawyers for Meta and Snap had argued that the executives should be spared from testifying at the upcoming trial. Meta's lawyers reportedly argued that forcing testimony from Zuckerberg and Mosseri would "set a precedent" for future trials. Meta is currently facing numerous lawsuits over alleged harms to younger users of its platforms. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Snap is also facing a number of lawsuits over alleged safety issues. In a statement, the law firm representing Snap said that the judge's order "does not bear at all on the validity of Plaintiffs claims" and that they "look forward to the opportunity to explain why Plaintiffs' allegations against Snapchat are wrong factually and as a matter of law.
