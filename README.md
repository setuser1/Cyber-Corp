Apple is sidelining plans to overhaul its Vision Pro VR glasses to focus on developing AI smart glasses that can compete with products from Meta, according to a new report from Bloombergs Mark Gurman.

Although the company had been developing a cheaper and lighter version of its Vision Pro, Apple is moving staff from that project to work on smart glasses.
