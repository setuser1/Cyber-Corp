Techtober is a busy time for our reviews team as a deluge of new devices arrive before the holiday season. Weve been hard at work conducting our in-depth testing, but its understandable if you missed a review or two over the last few weeks. Read on to catch up all the reviews you mightve missed, including the latest trio of Google Pixel devices.

Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a

Google / Engadget

88100Expert Score

Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold

It might not be super thin, but the Pixel 10 Pro Fold still has the best cameras of any flexible phone, slick software and now added durability thanks to the first IP68 rating on any foldable.

Pros

Great cameras

IP68 rating

Improved software and multitasking

Pixelsnap charging

Cons

Big and heavy

Expensive

Lackluster high-end performance

No Pro Res Zoom

$1,799 at Amazon

Earlier this month, a trio of new Pixel devices arrived for us to put through their paces. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold headlines the group, but the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2a are also highly capable devices in their own categories. Senior reviews writer Sam Rutherford wrote that Google has removed one of the last remaining issues with foldable phones: durability. “The addition of proper dust and water resistance on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold has removed one of the last two shortcomings of modern foldables, which is no mean feat,” he said. However, at $1,799, the price barrier is still hard to overcome for most folks.”

Meta Ray-Ban Display

Meta Ray-Ban Display

An exciting first-gen product, if you can get past the thick frames.

Pros

Display is bright, clear and doesn't feel overwhelming

Ability to preview and zoom in with the camera makes it way easier to frame shots

Visual feedback for Meta AI prompts is surprisingly helpful

Neural band is very accurate and reduces reliance on voice commands

Cons

Frames are way too thick for most people's comfort

Display is only compatible with a handful of apps

Text messages can be wonky

The second-gen Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses may be the best option for most people right now, but the Meta Ray-Ban Display is the more exciting product for many. If you can get past the chunky look and in-progress features, you still have to contend with limited availability and a $800 price tag. “The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, on the other hand, still look very much like a first-gen product,” senior reporter Karissa Bell wrote. “There are some really compelling use cases for the display, but its functionality is limited.”

ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X

ASUS/Engadget

88100Expert Score

ROG Xbox Ally X

While its $1,000 price may be an obstacle, ASUS and Microsoft's collaboration on the ROG Xbox Ally X has created a top-tier handheld with strong performance and better software than all of its Windows-based rivals.

Pros

New full-screen Xbox experience

Strong performance

Bright screen

Solid battery life

Cons

Expensive

Larger grips make it a bit bulky

Mediocre haptics

$1,000 at Best Buy

Microsofts collaboration with ASUS has produced a compelling gaming handheld thats decidedly Xbox. The combination of familiar controls and a full-screen Xbox experience give this device an advantage over its Windows-based competition. “While Microsofts first real foray into PC gaming handhelds isnt upending the status quo and its way too early to say if this gadget will save Xbox as a whole, it is bringing some notable advancements,” Sam said. “The new full-screen experience makes launching and playing games on Windows-based devices so much more seamless that its kind of wild it took so long to get here.”

Bose QuietComfort Headphones (2nd gen)

Bose/Engadget

87100Expert Score

Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Bluetooth Headphones (2nd gen)

The best noise-canceling headphones are even better with improved ANC, enhanced sound and more efficient power usage.

Pros

Industry-leading ANC got even better

Sound and power upgrades are substantial

Cons

Still expensive

Glossy finish isnt for everyone

$449 at Amazon

Bose never leave the top few spots on our best noise canceling headphones list, but its refresh of the QC Ultra Headphones put the company firmly back in first place. Updates to active noise cancellation, sound performance, battery life and power management are enough to recommend this model over the previous version and the Sony WH-1000XM6. “Similar to the second-gen QC Ultra Earbuds over the summer, Bose didnt make huge upgrades for the updated version of the QC Ultra Headphones,” I explained. “But what you do get here is a decent improvement over its predecessor.”

Razer Blade 18 (2025)

Razer/Engadget

80100Expert Score

Razer Blade 18 (2025)

The Blade 18 is a massive 18-inch gaming laptop with all of the power youd want, alongside Razers excellent build quality. Just be prepared to pay a ton for it.

Pros

Excellent performance

Effective cooling

Lovely 18-inch screen

Tons of ports

Great keyboard

Cons

Ridiculously expensive

Much heavier than 16-inch laptops

No OLED or MiniLED

$2,800 at Razer

Razers massive 18-inch gaming laptop has impressive performance, but its size and limited battery life dont offer a lot of convenience. “Personally, if I had to choose between Razers current lineup, Id go with the Blade 16 so that I could actually carry it around and occasionally use it as a productivity machine,” senior reviews editor Devindra Hardawar wrote. “Not so with the Blade 18 — its short two hour and 17 minute battery life (in PCMark 10s battery benchmark) means youll always need to lug around its beefy power adapter.”
