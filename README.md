Apple has removed ICEBlock, the app which allowed users to put a pin on a map to show where ICE agents have recently been spotted, from the App Store. It has also pulled other apps that served a similar purpose. According to Fox Business, Attorney General Pam Bondi demanded their takedown, telling Apple that the apps were "designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs." Bondi added that "violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed." She also said that the "Department of Justice will continue making every effort to protect [its] brave federal law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe."

"We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps," Apple told the publication in a statement. "Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store."

Bondi demanded the apps' removal after the FBI and the administration reported that the gunman who attacked an ICE facility in Dallas used tracking apps, including ICEBlock, to open fire from a rooftop. The gunman killed two immigrants and injured a third, but he was allegedly targeting ICE agents. Joshua Aaron, the app's developer, told Fox Business that he was "incredibly disappointed" by Apple's actions. "Capitulating to an authoritarian regime is never the right move," he said. "Apple has claimed they received information from law enforcement that ICEBlock served to harm law enforcement officers. This is patently false." Aaron added: "We are determined to fight this with everything we have. Our mission has always been to protect our neighbors from the terror this administration continues to reign down on the people of this nation."

ICEBlock climbed to the top of the App Store charts in July after administration officials slammed it, making more people aware of its existence. At the time, officials warned Aaron that they were "looking at him, and he better watch out" because the app threatens the lives of law enforcement agents. NBC News reports that it was downloaded more than 1 million times since it was introduced. Tom Homan, the administration's "border czar," recently told Fox News that the government will investigate the "people who put these apps up" because they put "law enforcement at great risk."
