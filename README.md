In the latest bid by a Silicon Valley defense firm to assert its own solution for the Armys mixed-reality ambitions, Anduril Industries on Monday unveiled “EagleEye,” a helmeted computing system that seeks to turn soldiers into AI-augmented warfighters.

The launch is notable given that the initiative is led by Anduris co-founder Palmer Luckey, who previously started the pioneering VR company, Oculus, which was acquired by Meta.
