The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is reassigning hundreds of employees across several of its agencies to assist in the Trump administrations broad immigration crackdown and will dismiss staffers who refuse to comply, according to news reports.

Bloomberg reported Wednesday that the department moved staffers from the U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA, many of whom focus on issuing cyber guidance to help U.S. government agencies and critical infrastructure defend from cyber threats, to other agencies within the federal department, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
