The hit horror comic series Something is Killing the Children is headed to the big (and small) screen. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Blumhouse is developing a live-action movie and adult animated series based on the comics. There are no details yet on the release timeline or casting.

Something is Killing the Children, created by writer James Tynion IV and illustrator Werther DellEdera, follows monster hunter Erica Slaughter in a reality where monsters exist and only children can see them. While it was announced back in 2023 that Netflix would be developing a TV series based on the comic and helmed by Dark creators Baran Bo Odar and Jantje Friese (which could have been awesome, honestly), that plan was scrapped last year, according to THR.

It's a big week for comics I love getting the TV/film treatment, and I am cautiously hyped (emphasis on cautious); the SIKTC news comes on the heels of the announcement that Charles Burns' Black Hole is being adapted for a Netflix series by Jane Schoenbrun (I Saw the TV Glow, We're All Going to the World's Fair). Fingers crossed that they dont suck!
