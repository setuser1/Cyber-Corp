Consumer AI is having its breakout moment — and few startups have captured the spotlight this year quite like Phia. The AI-powered shopping assistant has become one of 2025s buzziest launches, not only for its vision of how Gen Z shops, but also for the powerhouse founders leading it: Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni.

At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27–29 at San Franciscos Moscone West, the two will take to the Disrupt Stage to share how theyre building Phia into a durable consumer brand, what it takes to scale in one of techs most competitive markets, and how theyre turning viral buzz into lasting market influence.

The next era of consumer AI

Phia aims to reinvent the way digital natives discover, compare, and shop for products — blending AI assistance with the values of conscious consumerism. For Gen Z, the shopping journey is about more than convenience. Its about trust, personalization, and aligning choices with personal ethics. Gates and Kianni are betting that the next generation of consumer AI must deliver on all of those fronts at once.

From advocacy to AI

Phoebe Gates, co-founder of Phia, is an entrepreneur and passionate advocate for womens reproductive rights and gender equity. A Stanford graduate in human biology, she has worked with global healthcare leaders, activists, and advocates to drive meaningful social change. Gates applies her entrepreneurial focus to inspire a new generation of women in business. Recognized by Reproductive Freedom for All as the 2024 “Rising Reproductive Freedom Champion,” she continues to be a voice for progress while building Phia into a leading AI shopping brand.
