Samsung's take on the Vision Pro is here — and you can already order it. Costing just over half as much as Apple's reality machine, the Galaxy XR has a 4K micro-OLED screen and a 100-degree horizontal field of view. The $1,800 mixed reality headset is available now for pre-order on Samsung's website.

The Galaxy XR isn't only a Samsung product. The company developed the long-rumored headset alongside Google and Qualcomm. It's the first Android XR product, a line that will eventually include AI glasses "and beyond." You can read more about the headset and its ecosystem in Engadget's news coverage.

Given Google's connection to the Galaxy XR, it isn't too surprising that the company has bonuses for early orders. If you buy the headset before the end of 2025, you'll get "The Explorer Pack." That includes a year of access to Google AI Pro, YouTube Premium and Google Play Pass. Also included until the end of the year is the "XR Pack." This adds three months of YouTube TV, a year of NBA League Pass, NFL Pro Era, Adobe's Project Pulsar, Asteroid and Calm.

You can order the Galaxy XR now from Samsung's website and in Samsung Experience Stores. The headset costs $1,800. An optional Galaxy XR Controller costs $250. And somehow, the official Galaxy XR travel case also costs $250, which is — yikes — a lot. Perhaps consider waiting for third-party alternatives on the case front.

Samsung is offering a 24-month financing plan for the headset ($75.01 monthly) on its website. Meanwhile, Samsung's stores have that plan as well as a 12-month one ($149 monthly).
