Amazon founder Jeff Bezos made a rare public appearance at Italian Tech Week in Turin on Friday and used the opportunity to predict that millions of people will be living in space &#8220;in the next couple of decades,&#8221; the Financial Times reports.

Speaking with John Elkann, a scion of Italys Agnelli dynasty, Bezos, who also founded rocket company Blue Origin, insisted people will be living in space &#8220;mostly because they want to,&#8221; and that robots will handle the grunt work, while vast AI data centers float overhead.
