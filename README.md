Microsoft released a new batch of features for its AI assistant Thursday, including an ambitious project that builds artificial intelligence directly into one of its most central products. More than a simple extension, the Copilot Mode in Microsofts Edge browser is Microsofts take on the long-hyped AI browser category â€” an intelligent and flexible AI assistant that follows you as you browse the web.

Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI, even described the new product in those terms in the announcement. &#8220;Copilot Mode in Edge is evolving into an AI browser that is your dynamic, intelligent companion,&#8221; Suleyman wrote in the announcement post. &#8220;With your permission, Copilot can see and reason over your open tabs, summarize and compare information, and even take actions like booking a hotel or filling out forms.&#8221;
