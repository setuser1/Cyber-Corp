Portable Bluetooth speakers have become a must-have for music, podcasts and even calls when youre on the move. Whether youre heading to the beach, planning a camping trip or just want something more flexible to use around the house, the best portable speakers give you big sound in a compact design. They connect quickly to your phone, work indoors and outdoors, and many models are built to handle splashes or drops without cutting the music short.

Theres a huge variety to pick from, and not all are designed for the same purpose. Some focus on deep bass for parties, while others prioritize battery life so you can keep the music going all day (and night) long. Features like waterproofing, durability and multi-speaker pairing are worth thinking about if youre planning to use them outside often.

In this guide, weve tested and rounded up the best Bluetooth speakers available right now. Whether you want something pocket-sized for travel or a larger speaker to fill your living room with sound, youll find options here that match your style and budget.

Soundcore

Soundcore Select 4 Go

Features: Built-in carrying loop | Battery life: Up to 20 hours | Assistant support: None | Weight: 9.3 ounces | USB charging: Yes | Waterproof: Water‑resistant (IP67)

If you're looking to spend as little as possible and get a speaker that will free you from using your smartphone to blast out tunes, the Soundcore Select 4 Go is a good option. It has decent sound quality for a speaker its size, and it's loud enough to fill a standard-sized living room, bedroom or desk area outside. You can even pair two of them together to get bigger sound, too. It's IP67 water- and dustproof, and it's designed to float so it can handle an accidental dunk in the pool without any issue. And with a battery life of 20 hours, it'll provide music for the entirety of your next party without breaking a sweat. — Valentina Palladino, Deputy Editor

JBL

JBL Go 4

Features: Built-in carrying loop | Battery life: Up to 7 hours | Assistant support: None | Weight: 0.4 pound | USB charging: Yes | Waterproof: Water‑resistant (IP67)

JBL made a handy, convenient little speaker in the Go 4. It gets decently loud and doesn't sound too distorted at those higher volumes. Will it stand up to more expensive speakers on this list in terms of sound quality? No, but it sound good for its size, which is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. Made in part with recycled materials, the Go 4 is IP67 water- and dustproof, and you can pair two of these speakers together to get an even wider sounstage. — V.P.

Tribit StormBox Micro 2

Features: Built-in power bank to charge other devices | Battery life: Up to 12 hours | Assistant support: None | Weight: 1 pound | USB charging: Yes | Waterproof: Water‑resistant (IP67)

If youre just looking for a small Bluetooth speaker that can kick out some decent volume, the Tribit StormBox Micro 2 fits the bill. The audio quality here is fine; it doesnt stand out in terms of fidelity, but the volume you get from this affordable little speaker is what makes it a good choice. If youre bopping about outdoors on your bike or chilling in the park, its usually more about portability and volume anyway. The rubbery rear strap works well on relatively thin things like belts, backpacks and bike handlebars.

While its small and affordable, this mini speaker features a USB-C charging port for your devices in a pinch and you can wirelessly connect two of them for party mode or stereo sound. It also supports voice assistants for both iOS and Android users, and if you want to take calls on your phone via speakerphone, thats easy to do as well.

$60 at Amazon

Soundcore

Soundcore Motion 300

Features: IPX7 waterproof, custom EQ settings using companion app | Battery life: Up to 13 hours | Assistant support: None | Weight: 1.9 pounds | USB charging: Yes | Waterproof: Water‑resistant (IPX7)

Soundcore has been releasing some very able speakers lately and one of its newest is a quality personal portable. The Motion 300 is of the pint-sized variety, but offers 30-watts of punchy and bright output. Its IPX7 rated so it can handle a bit of water, and it works with the Anker Soundcore app that allows a fair amount of customization from EQ settings to button brightness. It also supports hi-res audio using the LDAC codec for Android users with a compatible device.

The Motion 300s size and frequency range dont quite allow for a ton of bass, but its relatively loud and thumpy, especially when it has surfaces to reflect off of. Soundcore has even extended its high-frequency range to 40kHz, and while its utility is debatable, the Motion 300 does sound crisp in the high-end spectrum. You can also enable adaptive audio, which helps optimize its sound delivery depending on the speaker orientation (on its back, standing up or hanging from its removable button-fastened strap).

The speakers design merges a funky style with office-machine chic, from the playfully speckled soft touch exterior to the metallic, logo-emblazoned grille. Its 1.7-pound weight and clutch-purse size makes it better as a handheld or stowed in your bag rather than hanging from a backpack or bike handlebars. Ultimately, you get great sound in a small package with features you can tweak to your liking, all at an approachable $80 price tag.

Ultimate Ears

UE Wonderboom 4

Features: IP67-rated design, support for stereo pairing | Battery life: Up to 14 hours | Assistant support: None | Weight: 1.2 pounds | USB charging: Yes | Waterproof: Water‑resistant (IP67)

The latest version of a previous pick (the Wonderboom 3), the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 is a tiny yet powerful portable that can deliver big sound. Its still a cute, barrel-shaped small speaker with a nubby little strap that probably needs a carabiner to help attach it to most things. It offers up to 14 hours on a single change, and underneath, you can easily access the protected USB-C port whenever you need to refill. With an IP67 rating on top of the companys five-foot drop test durability, it can go with you almost anywhere and survive to tell the tale.

Although theres no app support or connectivity with the rest of the Ultimate Ears speaker lineup, you can easily pair it with other UE speakers for stereo sound. Theres also an outdoor mode button on the bottom that boosts the mid and high range to help the audio carry over a greater distance — perfect for when you need a compact party speaker that still delivers the best sound possible in its class.

Anker Soundcore Motion+

Features: IPX7 waterproof, custom EQ settings using companion app | Battery life: Up to 12 hours | Assistant support: None | Weight: 2.3 pounds | USB charging: Yes | Waterproof: Water‑resistant (IPX7)

This nondescript wedge of a wireless speaker could easily slip under your radar, but its worth a listen. It has a bright and bassy output, which is helped along by Qualcomm aptX support for hi-res audio. This Anker Soundcore device has a solid, slightly heavy build with a metal front speaker grille, a soft-touch rubberized exterior (that loves your greasy fingerprints) and IPX7 water resistance. While its not the lightest or most portable, it has good sound, especially for the price. Plus the app offers EQ customization, so you can fine tune to your liking.

Theres also a 3.5mm aux input for wired connections. You can use it as a speakerphone when taking calls as well, or easily play music from your devices. Thats fortuitous, as we found that this small speaker works well as a mini soundbar alternative and the wired input offers a foolproof connection. Aside from that, you can easily charge the Motion+ thanks to its standard USB-C charging port and it should last up to 12 hours on a single charge.

$77 at Amazon

JBL

JBL Flip 7

Features: IP68-rated design, support for stereo pairing | Battery life: Up to 16 hours | Assistant support: None | Weight: 1.2 pounds | USB charging: Yes | Waterproof: Water‑resistant (IP68)

We considered the JBL Flip 6 the best JBL speaker for most people (you can still find it available online), and the JBL Flip 7 only improves upon the previous model. Sound quality is solid from lows to highs, even with the volume up at high registers. The cylindrical shape works well on its side or even standing on its end to save desk space. It has a capable carrying (or hanging) strap and raised buttons you can discern in the dark.

The JBL Portable app gives you a 3-band EQ to customize the sound profile if desired and if you have two Flip 7 speakers, you can run them as a stereo pair. If you happen to have a mix-and-match assortment of different PartyBoost-enabled JBL devices, you can connect multiple speakers for a bigger sound. And with a USB-C charging port, its a versatile device thats easy to take with you on the move.

Bose

Bose SoundLink Flex (2nd Gen)

Features: Built-in mic for assistant support and phone calls, IP67-rated design | Battery life: Up to 12 hours | Assistant support: Google Assistant, Siri | Weight: 1.3 pounds | Wireless range: 30 feet | USB charging: Yes | Waterproof: Water‑resistant (IP67)

While the $119 Bose SoundLink Micro is half the size, we found that it's definitely worth the extra $30 if you trade up to the SoundLink Flex. While its still not a room filler, the speaker offers some bright, dynamic finesse to your tunes, along with a significant amount of bass for its size. Its similar to the scale of a small clutch bag, with a very small strap for carabiner-type hanging. Much of the exterior is sheathed in soft-touch silicone, except for the powder-coated steel speaker grilles. Like others in this range, the speaker is IP67 rated so it can handle the elements and sound good doing it.

Setup and connecting to the speaker should be done from within the aptly named Bose Connect app. You can also turn off voice prompts (which can become annoying) and pair with similar speakers for either party mode or stereo.

Beats Pill

Read our full Beats Pill review

Features: IP67 waterproof, lossless audio over USB-C | Battery life: Up to 24 hours | Assistant support: Yes | Weight: 1.5 pounds | USB charging: Yes | Waterproof: Water‑resistant (IP67)

The new Pill has impressive bass performance due to the companys decision to increase the size of the woofer rather than keep its previous arrangement that included two smaller ones. The speaker struggles at its loudest volumes, but its plenty loud enough well below that. The IP67 rating is more rugged than the Pill+ and over 24 hours of battery life will keep the tunes going for a long time. Plus, theres lossless audio over USB-C and the ability to top off your phone or earbuds with the speakers battery.

This is a solid choice for anyone seeking crisp clarity with true low-end thump if a track demands it. The addition of lossless is also nice for times youd like a little more quality in your tunes. And you can also put two Pills together for bigger sound or use them as a stereo pair. — Billy Steele, Senior Reporter

Marshall

Marshall Emberton III

Features: IP67-rated design, support for stereo pairing | Battery life: Up to 30 hours | Assistant support: None | Weight: 0.26 pounds | USB charging: Yes | Waterproof: No

The Emberton III Bluetooth portable from Marshall continues to iterate on a design we've loved for a while. This clutchable rectangular slab has a max output of 20 watts to deliver the brands signature sound. It may not be the loudest in its size range, but it focuses more on balanced output than raw power. Theres still 360 sound as well, making it a good companion for small get togethers.

The latest model has more than 32 hours of battery life and a rugged IP67 rating. There's also a built-in microphone, so you can use it to take calls while you're getting ready for the day or chilling out in the backyard.

JBL

JBL Charge 6

Features: Built-in power bank to charge other devices, IP68-rated design, support for stereo pairing | Battery life: Up to 28 hours | Assistant support: None | Weight: 2.2 pounds | USB charging: Yes | Waterproof: Water‑resistant (IP68)

If youre willing to spend a little more for bigger sound and more hours of battery life, the midrange JBL Charge 6 is a great upgrade over the Flip 6 or Flip 7. It has the same bright output and capable low end, but in a slightly larger package. If youre looking for a smallish portable speaker, but something capable enough to entertain a few guests, this works.

Ultimate Ears

Ultimate Ears Everboom

Read our full UE Everboom review

Features: Waterproof, 360-degree audio, Outdoor Boost | Battery life: 20 hours | Assistant support: None | Weight: 2.11 pounds | USB-C charging: Yes | Waterproof: Water‑resistant (IP67)

The Everboom is a decent mid-range option in the Ultimate Ears lineup. The best features are its high durability and Outdoor Boost for better sound outside. Youll get loud, 360-degree audio, but like a lot of UE speakers, theres a lack of overall fidelity due to subdued mid-range tone. Theres plenty to like here, especially if youre looking for something to take on an adventure that wont weigh you down too much. The price is, however, a bit on the high side with the limited suite of features. But, all of the basics, and slightly more, are covered. Plus, it floats! — B.S.

Marshall Middleton

Features: IP67-rated design, support for stereo pairing | Battery life: Up to 20 hours | Assistant support: None | Weight: 3.9 pounds | USB charging: Yes | Waterproof: No

Marshall launched the Middleton in January 2023 and positioned it as the new flagship for its portable Bluetooth speaker line. Its the largest of the company's IP67 rugged portables (measuring 4.3 x 9 x 3.75 inches) and offers a significantly louder output, with 50-watts of 360-degree sound. There are dual woofers and tweeters for the front and back, with passive radiators along each side. It also offers Stack Mode, which lets you pair with any other Middleton, Emberton II or Willen speakers nearby to expand your listening experience.

The Middleton can be managed through the Marshall Bluetooth app, but it also includes most of those same controls on the top. Theres a Bluetooth button (which doubles as the Stack Mode control) and a multi-use joystick for power on/off, volume control and track selection (forward or back). You also get bass and treble controls, which are a welcome addition and a first for one of Marshalls speakers without physical knobs.

It has that traditional Marshall look, made with a soft-touch exterior composed of 55-percent post-consumer recycled plastic and is 100-percent PVC free. It also has a carry strap you can easily fit your hand through. Any dust, dirt or prints on the outside can be scrubbed off with a damp cloth, and even the exposed USB-C and 3.5mm input port components are waterproofed. That USB-C port can be used to recharge the speaker, or power up your other devices with its 9,600mAh battery.

Of course audio purists should know that it only supports SBC, but the sound quality is still top notch for most people. And while Marshall devices are usually priced at a slight premium, the good sound quality and decent low-end capability definitely makes this model worth checking out.

JBL

JBL Xtreme 4

Features: IP67-rated design| Battery life: Up to 24 hours | Assistant support: None | Weight: 4.6 pounds | USB charging: Yes | Waterproof: Water‑resistant (IP67)

If youve enjoyed any of the smaller JBL speakers out there and are willing to spend a bit more, the Xtreme 4 is a good all-around choice. Its big enough to warrant a shoulder strap, but still only about the size of a football. When we tested the previous version, the Xtreme 3, we found it to have pleasant dynamic sound, with hefty lows and a lively high end that seems slightly better balanced at this size than the smaller options from JBL in this range.

This is easily a favorite if you want something under $400 with a little more gusto than your average portable, but still being IP67 weatherproof. It has enough output to breathe life into a small soiree or backyard hang, although while its quite loud, its best when its close by or indoors where the bass can resonate to its fullest.

Marshall Tufton

Features: IPX2-rated design, support for multi-host functionality | Battery life: Up to 20 hours | Assistant support: None | Weight: 10.8 pounds | USB charging: No | Waterproof: Water‑resistant (IPX2)

If you didnt know about Marshalls history in amplifiers and rock music, the design should clue you in. The Tufton is the largest portable Bluetooth speaker from the company, looking much like an amp itself (as do most of them). It has physical knobs at the top and a carry strap to help move it about. While it may appear as rugged as concert gear, its less impervious to the elements as some with just an IPX2 rating, so its protected from light splashes from above.

Whether or not youre a fan of the brand, the rich and distinctly thumping output may make you one. We felt pulled into the sound while listening to the Tufton, a bit more than most other speakers we tested at this scale. Its dynamic, warm and, dare we say, analog in its audio presence. Its also multi-directional with a supplemental driver on the back along with a bass port.

Theres no app to adjust the EQ, just the physical controls including a Bluetooth connect button, a power/volume knob and two for bass and treble. Once powered on, you can use the volume knob to set a max headroom and adjust volume on the fly from your source. The bass and treble knobs help you choose the tone of your adventure, from a purely flat soundscape to an enhanced one. We just wish you could see the dial indicators in the dark. Other features include aptX support and quick-charge capabilities that provide four hours of listening time in just 20 minutes, plus great standby battery life.

Ultimate Ears Hyperboom

Features: IPX4-rated design, support for multi-host functionality | Battery life: Up to 24 hours | Assistant support: None | Weight: 13 pounds | USB charging: No | Waterproof: Water‑resistant (IPX2)

The UE Hyperboom is an all-arounder with good looks, portability, plenty of connectivity options and a loud and punchy (albeit compressed) output. The technical fabric exterior (which now includes a white option) lets it live among your furniture without screaming “party box,” while the optical input offers a possible TV speaker alternative. The large capacitive buttons on top let anyone adjust the volume, pause or play the music and select from two concurrent Bluetooth connections or a hardwired input (3.5mm or optical). On the edge with the silicone carrying handle there are the wired ports, plus one for charging USB devices and another for power. You can expect to get up to 24 hours of battery life, and the Hyperboom is good at holding a charge on standby.

This capable and loud (roughly 100dB) speaker will please most people as long as the party is of primary concern over fidelity. The ability to remotely power your device on or off using the UE app is also a welcome feature. Plus you can easily expand the sound to other Ultimate Ears Boom speakers (except Wonderboom) using the PartyUp feature. The IPX4 rating means a few spilled drinks wont hassle it, but its not the best Bluetooth speaker choice for all-weather adventures.

Factors to consider in a portable Bluetooth speaker

Weather-proofing

IP ratings (Ingress Protection) are the alphanumeric indicators you often see in a products spec sheet that define water and dust resistance. Its usually a combo of two numbers with the first indicating solid object ingress and the second being water. The former goes from 0 (no protection) to 6 (dustproof). The water-resistance rating goes from 0 (no protection) to 9 (protected against immersion and high pressure jets). When an X is used instead of a number, that means the product wasnt tested for resistance. If its a waterproof speaker, it may have some innate resistance to solids, but theres no guarantee.

IP67 is a common rating these days indicating highly resistant and potentially rugged speakers often featured in audio products like outdoor speakers. These are safe for quick dunks in the pool or tub and should be more than OK in the rain or in the shower. Theyre also good options for the beach, playground and other rough environs.

Additionally, speakers with ports and a high rating will often include a tight-fitting cover over the charging or auxiliary ports. If you plan on using the ports, that may limit the product's rated ability to fend off the elements.

When looking for the best portable Bluetooth speaker, consider the IP rating and also how you plan to use your Bluetooth speaker when making your decision. It may be worth splurging on a better sounding model with a lower IP rating if youll mostly be using it indoors, for instance.

Battery life

The focus of this guide is on the best portable speakers, and while “portable” can be a relative term, these devices are generally for people who are likely to find themselves far from a power outlet. These days, around 12 hours of playtime seems to be the baseline but obviously, the more battery life you can get out of a speaker, the better, especially if you plan to listen to podcasts or music on the go.

That said, be careful when looking at battery specs, as they frequently list a maximum runtime (“up to” x amount of hours). This usually means they tested at a low to mid volume. If you like your tunes loud with punchy bass, it can often end up cutting the expected usage time in half or more. Luckily, some manufacturers also list the expected hours of battery life when used at full volume and that transparency is appreciated. Bear in mind, however, that not all of the best Bluetooth speakers use the same charging port. Some support USB-C charging, while others use micro-USB, and some may even come with an adapter for added convenience.

Additionally, if your audio system or mini Bluetooth speaker also happens to have Wi-Fi connectivity, they're usually designed for always-on functionality. Unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that go to sleep after a short period without use, these will usually stay awake (to listen for your commands) and slowly run down the battery. If you're out and about, you'll want to remember to turn these speakers off manually when not in use to maximize battery life.

Range

Bluetooth 5 offers better range and more reliable connectivity than its predecessors, making it a great feature to look for in the best Bluetooth speaker. That said, Bluetooth range can still be tricky. Some companies list their products longest possible range, usually outdoors and in an unobstructed line-of-sight test environment. Other companies stick with a 30-foot range on the spec sheet and leave it at that, even though they may be running Bluetooth 4.x or 5.x. Thats likely underselling the speaker's potential, but unpredictable environments can affect range and theres little point in promising the moon only to get complaints.

Ive seen signal drop issues when crouching down, with my phone in the front pocket of my jeans, and barely 30 feet away from a speaker inside my apartment. I ran into this issue across several devices regardless of their listed Bluetooth connectivity range.

If youre hosting a patio party and duck inside, its wise to keep any wireless Bluetooth speakers relatively close by just in case. Its hard to gauge what aspects of any environment may interfere with a Bluetooth signal. In general, take range specs around 100 feet or more as a perfect-world scenario.

Latency

This is a minor mention for those out there who use a speaker for their computer output, or as a mini Bluetooth soundbar solution for setups like a monitor and streaming box. Its annoying to find that your speakers latency isnt low enough to avoid lip sync issues. Luckily, it seems that most speakers these days dont often have these problems. Only a handful of the few dozen speakers I tried had persistent, noticeable lip-sync issues. Aside from occasional blips, all of our picks worked well in this regard.

If you plan to frequently use a speaker for video playback, look for devices with the most recent Bluetooth 5 technology and lower latency codecs like aptX. Also make sure the speaker is close to the source device as distance can be a factor. To avoid the issue altogether, though, consider getting one with a wired auxiliary input.

Extra features

Some speakers dont just play music — they bring the party to life with built-in LED light effects and a full-on light show that syncs to your music. If you love a bit of visual flair with your tunes, its worth checking out models that offer LED light customization options.

Sound quality also plays a huge role in picking the right speaker. The best Bluetooth speaker should deliver a balanced mix of punchy bass, clear highs and strong vocals. Many models also include customizable sound modes that let you tweak the EQ to better suit different genres — whether youre blasting EDM, listening to a podcast, or just want a more immersive experience that would impress even an audiophile.

If aesthetics matter, many models come in a tiny size that makes them extra portable, with plenty of color options to match your personal style. Whether you want a sleek black speaker or a vibrant eye-catching design, there are plenty of choices to fit your vibe.

Other portable Bluetooth speakers we tested

Sonos Roam

While there's a lot to like about the Sonos Roam, there are plenty of other Bluetooth speakers with more features and better battery life. In our review, we gave the Roam a score of 87, praising it for its good sound quality, durable waterproof design and ability to work well within an existing Sonos speaker ecosystem. But the price is just fine at $180, and we found Bluetooth speakers that offer more at lower price points. Plus, the Roam taps out at 10 hours of battery life, and all of our top picks can run for longer than that on a single charge.

Monoprice Soundstage3

The Monoprice Soundstage3 offers relatively big sound at a midrange $250 price, with a variety of inputs rarely found on a portable Bluetooth speaker. The boxy, minimalist design is no nonsense, even if it's more of a less-rugged, bookshelf-styled homebody. While the speaker puts out crisp highs alongside booming lows, we found the bass can overpower the rest of the output, so it's not for everyone. And after using the speaker for many months, we also found the low-slung, poorly labeled button panel along the top can be a bit annoying to use. If you want a speaker for road trips, favor mids and highs, and plan on using physical buttons for volume control and input selections, there are better options out there.

JBL Boombox 3

Fans of JBLs bluetooth speaker sound profile who want to crank up the volume, but also want a rugged and portable option, may enjoy the JBL Boombox 3. Its a decent grab-and-go speaker with a very loud output, although it's not as good as some of the loud-speaker styled options for long-throw sound and big outdoor areas. However, the price for this speaker line remains prohibitively expensive compared to other options with big sound that cover a bit more ground. If the JBL brand is your thing and you like the rugged, portable form factor, we recommend looking for discounts, or shopping around and exploring the available options including the (less portable) JBL PartyBox series.

Soundcore Motion X500

Soundcore speakers have generally been good and often reasonably priced. The Motion X500 loosely falls into that category. It has a tall, metallic lunchbox vibe with a fixed handle and pumps out a respectable 40 watts of crisp, clear sound for its size. It can get pretty loud and serves up a good dose of bass, although its primarily a front-facing speaker.

Theres LDAC hi-res audio support for Android users, but the main selling point on this is spatial audio. This is done through an EQ change and the activation of a small, up-firing driver. Theres a slight benefit from this if youre up close and directly in front of it, but its not a total game changer for your listening experience. The original pre-order price of $130 made it a decent option in terms of bang for your buck. But it went up to $170 at launch, making it less appealing even if its still a good middle-of-the-road option if you want small-ish, clear and loud. If you can find one on sale for the lower price, its definitely worth considering. Theres also the larger and louder X600 ($200) if the overall concept is working for you.

Portable Bluetooth speaker FAQs

How does a Bluetooth speaker work?

Bluetooth technology lets devices connect and exchange data over short distances using ultra high frequency (UHF) radio waves. Its the frequency range thats carved out for industrial, scientific and medical purposes, called the 2.4GHz ISM spectrum band. This range is available worldwide, making it easy for companies to use with devices for global markets.

Bluetooth speakers include this tech, which lets them communicate with source devices like smartphones, tablets or computers in order to exchange data. The two devices pair by sharing a unique code and will work within the proscribed range for the device and Bluetooth version.

Ever since Bluetooth 4.0 was released over a decade ago, new iterations usually improve on range, use less power and offer expanded connectivity with features like multipoint (allowing more than one device to be connected at the same time, for instance).

Who should buy a Portable Bluetooth speaker?

If you want to play music while youre out-and-about on something other than headphones, a portable Bluetooth speaker is probably what you want. Theres a broad range of devices for all types of circumstances. Many adventurous people will want a relatively lightweight portable thats rugged enough to handle the elements while also packing enough charge to play for hours on end. Others may simply need a speaker they can move around the house or use in the backyard. In this case, you can choose larger less rugged models that may offer better sound.
