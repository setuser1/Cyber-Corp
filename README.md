Amazon calls this one Prime Big Deal Days, but to you, me and most everyone else, its the October Prime Day sale. But it ends tonight. This guide covers tech and gadgets that go for under $50 after the discount, but only ones we recommend. These are the batteries, mice, earbuds, speakers, wall chargers and other accessories that the Engadget team has tested for our guides and reviews. Read on for Engadgets guide to the best Prime Day tech deals for under $50.

Belkin Power Bank with Integrated Cable 10K for $27 ($13 off with Prime): Anyone who has known the pain of having a back up battery, but no cable to connect it will appreciate Belkins nifty power bank. Its our pick for a medium capacity power bank with enough oomph to refill a smartphone around three times.

$27 at Amazon

Apple MagSafe charger (25W, 2m) for $29 ($20 off): The latest version of Apple's MagSafe puck is Qi2.2-certified and supports up to 25W of wireless power when paired with a 30W adapter. The two-meter cable length on this particular model gives you more flexibility on where you can use it: in bed, on the couch, at your desk and elsewhere. (Note: the discount here has fluctuated between $29, $35 and $43 throughout the sale.)

Moft Magnetic Wallet Stand for $24 ($6 off with Prime): I like to carry as little as possible, preferably in my pockets. This nifty wallet attaches to MagSafe phones (iPhones 12 and newer), has room for two cards and has a pop-out stand for screen-viewing in either portrait or vertical orientation.

PNY microSD Express (128GB) for $39 ($6 off with Prime): If youve gotten yourself a Switch 2 (or planning to gift one for the Holidays) you may want to get a couple microSD Express cards. Theyre the only type that work with the new console, which you can read all about in our guide to Switch 2 storage. This is one of the cards we recommend.

Lexar 256GB Play PRO microSD Ex for $50 ($10 off with Prime): Heres another of our picks for a Switch 2-compatible storage card. The 512GB option is on sale too, but its more than $50.

Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazons audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point.

Moft Folding Sit-Stand Laptop Stand for $48 ($12 off with Prime): I take this with me when I have to work someplace away from my standing desk. It holds a 16-inch MacBook Pro 10 inches off a desk, which is just enough for you to stand up and work. It also configures into four other positions for better ergonomics as you sit. Its one of our favorite MacBook accessories.

UGREEN Nexode Pro 65W USB-C Flat Charger for $43 ($13 off with Prime): One of our picks from our guide to fast chargers, this Ugreen fella has three ports (one of which is USB-A) and a 65-watt max power output. The folding prongs make it even more compact. Just note that its a bit wide and may block adjacent outlets in a crowded power strip.

Anker USB C Charger (Nano II 65W) for $26 ($14 off with Prime): Anker makes some of our favorite charging accessories. This one has three USB ports, two Type C and one Type A, plus a max speed of 65 watts.

UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB-C Hub for $37 ($18 off with Prime): The top pick in our guide to the best USB-C hubs has a good array of ports, including an HDMI 2.0 connection that supports 4K monitors at 60Hz, plus three USB-A ports, Ethernet and one USB-C (plus another for delivering 90W of power to your device.

Anker Nano Charger, USB-C 30W charger for $13 ($4 off with Prime): Heres a tiny but mighty wall adapter that we like for iPhones (but it would work for an iPad too). It can pass on 30 watts of power to your device and looks nice doing it in five different pearlescent shades.

Elgato Stream Deck Mini for $50 ($10 off with Prime): We like Elgato gear for game streaming, but the handy shortcut deck can also be used for your nine to five. This six-button box can give you better control over PowerPoint presentations, video conferencing calls and spreadsheet wrangling.

INIU MagSafe Qi2 power bank for $34 ($16 off with Prime): This is the budget pick in our guide to the best MagSafe batteries. Not only can it refuel a dying iPhone (12 or newer) wirelessly, it comes with its own USB-C cable (that doubles as a handy carrying strap) so you can charge up other devices, too.

Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 ($20 off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E with double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks. It earned an honorable mention in our guide to streaming devices and also happens to make a good retro gaming emulator.

Anker

Anker Nano Ultra Slim 5K Power Bank

$40$55

Save $15 with Prime

Anker Nano 5K ultra-slim power bank (Qi2, 15W) for $40 ($15 off with Prime): The top pick in our guide to the best MagSafe power banks is a much better deal than the battery Apple is selling. This super-slim battery gives an extra charge to any Qi2-enabled phone (iPhones series 12 and later). We found its proportions work very well with iPhones, and its smooth, matte texture and solid build quality make it feel premium.

Lego Icons Dried Flower Centerpiece for $35 ($15 off with Prime): Who doesnt love a good Lego set? Only people who dont like fun. This floral centerpiece looks good enough to stick on a dining table and itll never die.

Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year.

Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off with Prime): Having a bad cable is almost as bad as not having a cable at all. Were big fans of Ankers cords. This one is a generous 10 feet and can deliver up to 100W of power. While it can transfer data, it does so slowly, so dont grab this one for that purpose. This is $1 more than it sold for as a Prime-exclusive in July.

Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): If you lose stuff, stop it with a Bluetooth tracker like this. The Pop is our top pick in our guide. It works with either Apples Find My app or Googles Find Hub app, calling on iPhone or Android phone users respectively to anonymously ping your lost stuff so you can find it.

Pebblebee Clip Universal for $25 ($10 off with Prime): This is our runner up pick for a rechargeable Bluetooth tracker. Its ear-splittingly loud, has bright flashing LEDs and works with either Google or Apples finding networks.

Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 for $20 ($10 off with Prime): Our favorite Bluetooth tracker for Samsung users is one of the best-looking fobs we tried. Its got a wide finding network, drawing on nearby Samsung phones to ping your lost items (though not as large as Google or Apples networks).

Blink Video Doorbell for $35 ($35 off): True, Amazon just announced new Blink devices, but those wont hit the market until after Prime Day is over. If you want a video doorbell right now at an impressively low price, this should serve. Weve tested Blink security devices before and have been impressed by what you get for such a small price.

Blink Video Doorbell & Blink Mini 2 for $40 ($70 off): Heres a bundle that combines a Blink Doorbell and a Mini 2 security camera. But again, new Blink cameras are on their way, so only get this if you're ok with last years tech.

Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off): At $49.99 this juuust qualifies as an under $50 tech deal. If you dont have doorbell wires at your front entrance, you can still have a camera to capture all the package deliveries and neighborhood animal sightings with the Ring Battery Doorbell. It records video in HD with more vertical coverage than the last model, so you can see people from head to toe. Just note that newer Ring devices are on the way.

Blink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off): This is currently the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside.

Blink Mini 2 security cameras (three-pack) for $50 ($50 off): A three pack is also on sale and squeezes in just under the $50 mark. Or you can just get one camera for $20.

Amazon Echo Pop Kids

$33$50

Save $17 with Prime

Amazon Echo Pop Kids for $33 ($17 off with Prime): Among the announcements for the new Echo devices, Amazon did not include new Echo Pop Kids models, so this is still the most current model for now. Its good for smaller spaces, not necessarily audio fidelity, and it comes with six months of free access to Amazon Kids as well as early access to Alexa+.

Anker 622 5K magnetic power bank with stand for $28 ($20 off with Prime): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up.

J-Tech Digital Ergonomic Mouse for $17 ($7 off with Prime): This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off).

Razer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $30 ($40 off): Some prefer a wired connection when playing games. Razers Basilisk V3 is our top budget pick for a wired mouse in our gaming mouse guide. Its comfortable, well-built, accurate and a good value — particularly with a Prime Day discount.

OtterBox Made for Kids Case for iPad (A16) for $49 ($21 off with Prime): Where other cases failed, this one has managed to keep my third graders iPad alive and functioning. Itll fit the newest standard iPad or the 10th generation model that came before it.

Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhoods Ring-captured events. Just note that a new Ring indoor model was just announced.

Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener.

Ultimate Ears MINIROLL Bluetooth speaker for $48 ($32 off with Prime): Ultimate Ears speakers make a couple of appearances in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. The Miniroll is the smaller sibling of the UE Wonderboom. Youll sacrifice a little in the sound department, but it maintains a similarly durable waterproof and dustproof build.

Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger for $32 ($13 off with Prime): Its a wall charger! Its a portable battery! It has its own USB-C cable! In short, this handy power bank is clever and compact, which is why its one of our favorites.

Anker Nano portable charger for $20 ($10 off with Prime): It looks like an oldy timey lipstick case and can deliver a partial refill to any small device with a USB-C port. We named it a good pick after testing it for our battery guide.

Twelve South AirFly SE for $28 ($12 off with Prime): We recommend this in our fathers day gift guide and a couple of our travel guides. If you know youre travelling on a plane with screens in the backs of the seats, you may want Twelve Souths gadget. It lets you connect your wireless earbuds to the aux jack. Also a good pick for gym equipment.

Levoit Mini Core-P air purifier for $40 ($10 off with Prime): This is the mini version of the top pick in our guide to air purifiers. It has a three-stage filter (pre, activated carbon and particle filters) though that particle filter is not a true HEPA filter. But its rated at 250 square feet and can help clear the air in your office or other small room.

8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller (Switch 2) for $43 ($27 off with Prime): If youve got a Switch 2 and are looking for a good controller to go with it, we think this is a good one. Recommended in our guide to the best Switch 2 accessories, its got an Xbox style configuration with the left stick placed higher on the game pad, which some prefer. The lowest price we tracked before this is $50.

Roku

Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 4K

$24$40Save $16

Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 (40 percent off): This is our top pick for the best streaming device for accessing free and live content.

Anker 555 USB-C Hub for $36 ($14 off with Prime): To give your iPad (or even your laptop) more connection options, pick up this USB-C hub. Its the model we liked best for our guide to MacBook accessories and adds an HDMI port, an SD card reader, Ethernet jack and two USB-A ports. It also has one data USB-C port and a pass through power delivery USB-C port, along with a built-in USB-C cable.

Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazons lineup. The sound wont be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexas help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year.

Elden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off): If you somehow havent yet played the action-RPG Elden Ring, heres a chance to do so for less money. Its challenging yet accessible if you want plus its darkly funny and one of our favorite games.

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5) for $35 ($15 off with Prime): We gave this game a favorable review last year. But just note that youll get more out of it if youve played Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

Belkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2 for $25 ($5 off with Prime): While this model doesnt have the battery pack like Belkins charging case that we reviewed, it will still offer more than enough protection for everyday bumps and tumbles just like its more expensive counterpart.

Belkin Apple AirTag holder for $15 ($5 off with Prime): The best thing about Apples AirTags are their ability to rope in most any nearby iPhone to anonymously hunt for lost trackers. The worst thing is probably the tiny, slippery disk shape that cant attach to anything without some help. This is the help we suggest in our iPhone accessories guide.

Ultimate Ears Wonderboom Play speaker for $48 ($42 off with Prime): This is a relative of the Wonderboom 4, one of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. It only has one driver and passive radiator, while the Wonderboom 4 has two of each. The battery life isnt quite as long here, either (10 hours compared to 14). But this one is currently half the price of its sibling.

Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): We named this thumbdrive one of the best SSDs you can buy. This configuration has 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation.

Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you dont care about 4K (or your screen resolution isnt that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it.

Belkin 45W Dual USB C Charger Block for $29 ($11 off with Prime): Members of my family fight over this handy wall charger. It has exactly what you need, two USB-C ports and speedy, 45W charging, perfect for juicing up a phone and tablet in tandem.

Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $38 ($32 off with Prime): This is an updated version of the electric scrubber we love that makes shower cleaning easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C.

Blink Outdoor 4 security camera for $35 ($45 off): We named this the best choice for Alexa users in our guide to security cameras. It works seamlessly with Alexa devices like the Echo speakers and Show displays. Plus it can run for up to two years on a set of AA batteries and we found the motion detection to be spot on.

Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level.

Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 ($12 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust.

Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off with Prime): This small speaker was a past pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. Its waterproof and goes for 24 hours on a charge. We found the sound to be surprisingly big for its size.

Amazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year.

Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage.

Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam $40 ($20 off): If you like the idea of being able to move the camera around to follow the action in your home, you may want to get a pan-and-tilt option like this one. We will again note that new Ring devices are on the way, but if you dont have to have the latest thing and just want to see what your dog gets up to while youre gone, you may want to snag this 33 percent discount.

Anker Soundcore Space A40 for $43 ($37 off with Prime): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity.

JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off with Prime): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the apps preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours.
