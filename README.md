President Trump had planned an operation to “surge” San Francisco by marching National Guard troops into the city, but was convinced to alter course, he said on a post on his social network Truth Social on Thursday. Nvidias Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff were among the tech industrys luminaries who called him and convinced him to change his mind, the post said.

San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie confirmed in a statement that the military operation had been planned and called off, although he didnt name names as to who had conversations with the President.
