As the world races to stay ahead in the deep tech revolution &#8212; from AI and semiconductors to quantum computing &#8212; innovation has become the new currency of power. For many companies, that pressure has translated into heavier workloads and more intense work cultures. Yet they face a real dilemma: they cant simply ease up while competitors across the globe push harder to win.

When I came across news about the intense &#8220;996&#8221; work culture &#8212; working 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week, a 72-hour work week &#8212; spreading from China to Silicon Valley, it made me wonder how different countries approach work hours and workplace cultures in the tech industry. I was especially curious about how things compare here in South Korea, where Im currently based.
