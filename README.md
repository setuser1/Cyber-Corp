Jeff Bezos space company Blue Origin scrubbed the second launch of its New Glenn mega-rocket planned for Sunday afternoon due to concerns with weather, a few minor problems with launch pad equipment, and at least one cruise ship that strayed too close to the flight path.

The company said late Sunday that it will take another go at launching New Glenns second mission on Wednesday, November 12. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced restrictions on space launches late last week due to the government shutdown, and Blue Origin said in a post on X Sunday that it worked with the FAA to make the second attempt happen. The launch windo opens at 2:50 p.m. ET and lasts until 4:17 p.m. ET.
