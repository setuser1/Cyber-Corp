EA has had quite the month, and the numbers tell its story. A few weeks ago, the company confirmed an agreement to go private in a $55 billion sale. And now we know that Battlefield 6 sold over 7 million copies in its first three days. The game also had over 172 million online matches played during the holiday weekend. On top of that, it logged 15 million hours watched on streaming services.

Battlefield 6's sales numbers make it the biggest opening yet for the franchise. By comparison, 2021's Battlefield 2042 reportedly sold a relatively paltry 4.2 million copies in its first week.

The quotes in EA's blog post read like awards ceremony acceptance speeches. "First and foremost, we want to thank our players," franchise General Manager Byron Beede said. "We never take moments like this for granted, so I want to express our sincere gratitude to our global Battlefield Studios and passionate community that has helped get us to this point," Executive VP Vince Zampella added.

The game's launch came weeks after the company's announcement that it will go private. The gaming giant will be owned by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners. On Wednesday, unionized EA staffers spoke out against the acquisition, warning that "every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency and power."

Battlefield 6 launched on October 10. It's available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. Its Season 1 content is just around the corner, arriving on October 28.
