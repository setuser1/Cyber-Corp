Instagram announced on Friday that it will now let you go back and see your previously watched Reels thanks to a new &#8220;Watch History&#8221; feature. Rival TikTok has had a Watch History feature for a few years now.

With the new feature, you can go back and find videos you might not have had the chance to save. For example, you could be watching an interesting Reel and then receive a phone call, or accidentally close the app while watching, or get distracted by something else and lose your place in the Reels feed.
