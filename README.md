Dorothy Kilroy has seen her companys smart ring on some very famous fingers. Mark Zuckerberg wears one. So does Jack Dorsey. Prince Harry, too. But when Oura&#8216;s chief commercial officer sat down at Torontos Elevate conference with this editor last week, she surprised me, saying the companys fastest-growing user segment isnt tech billionaires or wellness-obsessed execs. Its women in their early twenties.

It highlighted what an interesting moment this is for Oura. The 13-year-old Finnish health tech company essentially invented the smart ring category and turned it into a billion-dollar business. But now competitors are circling, including Samsung with its Galaxy Ring, Ultrahuman with its no-subscription pitch, and Whoop with its athletic performance mystique. Each one promises to take a bite out of Ouras lead.
