When Nick Turley joined OpenAI in 2022 as the head of ChatGPT, he was tasked with commercializing the companys research. He has made great strides toward that goal, growing the product to 800 million weekly active users. Now Turley wants to take an even bigger swing: transforming ChatGPT into a new type of operating system full of third-party apps.

I sat down with Turley this week on the outskirts of San Franciscos Fort Mason, a former U.S. military post where OpenAI held its third annual developer conference, to discuss how hes thinking about ChatGPTs future. You can find a transcript of our conversation at the bottom of this article.
