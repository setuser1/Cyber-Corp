President Donald Trump made countering immigration one of his flagship issues during last years presidential campaign, promising an unprecedented number of deportations.

In his first eight months in office, that promise turned into around 350,000 deportations, a figure that includes deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE (around 200,000), Customs and Border Protection (more than 132,000), and almost 18,000 self-deportations, according to CNN.
