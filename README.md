OpenAI and Jony Ive face significant technical challenges as they work to develop a screen-less, AI-powered device, according to the Financial Times.

Back in May, OpenAI acquired io, the device startup founded by the legendary Apple designer with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, for $6.5 billion. At the time, Altman declared that Ive and his team would help the company â€œcreate a new generation of AI-powered computers,&#8221; while Bloomberg reported that the first devices to emerge from the deal were scheduled to launch in 2026.
