OpenAI and Jony Ive could still have some serious loose ends to tie up before releasing their highly anticipated AI device. According to a Financial Times report, the partnership is still struggling with some "technical issues" that could ultimately end up pushing back the device's release date, which is expected to be sometime in 2026.

One of those lingering dilemmas involves figuring out the AI assistant's voice and mannerisms, according to FT's sources. The AI device is meant to be "a friend who's a computer who isn't your weird AI girlfriend," according to a FT source who was briefed on the plans. Beyond landing on a personality, OpenAI and Ive are still figuring out potential privacy concerns stemming from a device that's always listening. On top of that, the budget could reportedly be a challenge due to the increased computing power necessary to run these mass-produced AI devices.

Outside these latest struggles, we still know very little about the upcoming product. Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, reportedly offered some clues to employees that it could be pocket-sized, aware of its environment and sans display. There are still plenty of questions about what OpenAI's first hardware project will amount to, but the company could be exercising more caution since similar devices, like the Humane AI Pin, were discontinued after failing to deliver on sales.
