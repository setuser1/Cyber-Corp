Apple insiders are pointing to a tactile new future for the company's laptops. Last month, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that Apple would incorporate touchscreens into MacBooks some time in the next few years, "further blurring the line with the iPad." Today, Mark Gurman at Bloomberg confirmed that prediction, sharing even more specifics about the touchscreen approach for a MacBook Pro that is currently projected for release in late 2026 or early 2027.

Gurman reports that the touchscreen laptops are internally known as K114 and K116, and will run on M6 chips; Apple just introduced the M5 generation of its silicon for this year's iteration of the MacBook Pro and iPad Pro. His sources also say that the laptops will have OLED screens and will boast "a reinforced hinge and screen hardware" so that the display portion doesn't move when being used. The laptops will still have a trackpad and keyboard for non-touchscreen control, and will be housed in "thinner and lighter frames." Finally, this laptop will reportedly abandon the notch housing for the MacBook Pro's camera in favor of a hole-punch design that leaves a display area around that sensor.

Longtime Apple leader Steve Jobs was adamantly opposed to touchscreen computers. But most other computer companies have had touchscreen models available for about a decade, so Apple did adhere to that philosophy for a really long time. Rather than bring touch to a laptop, for a while Apple was trying to position the iPad as being capable of doing all the tasks you'd use a laptop for, as epitomized in the notorious "what's a computer?" ad. It should be interesting to see how touch MacBooks and iPads will coexist.
