Anthropic launched a web app on Monday for its viral AI coding assistant, Claude Code, which lets developers create and manage several AI coding agents from their browser.

Claude Code for web is now rolling out to subscribers to Anthropics $20-per-month Pro plan, as well as its $100- and $200-per-month Max plans. Pro and Max users can access Claude Code on the web by navigating to claude.ai (the same website for Anthropics consumer chatbot) and clicking into the &#8220;Code&#8221; tab, or through the Claude iOS app.
