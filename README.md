Spotify recently came under fire for running recruitment ads for ICE, which ask users to "join the mission to protect America" and to "fulfill [their] mission," in the US. Despite music labels calling on the streaming service to stop serving ICE recruitment ads, Spotify doubled down. A spokesperson for the company told The Independent that the ads are "part of a broad campaign" by the US government running across different channels and that they do not violate its policies. The spokesperson advised users to just mark ads with a thumbs up or down so that the app can learn their preferences.

In addition, several artists have pulled their music from Spotify recently over its CEO's, Daniel EK's, investments in European defense tech firm Helsing. The defense company builds drones, aircraft and submarines, and it also sells AI software that can analyze sensor and weapons data from battlefields. Spotify has been facing backlash for its payout rates, which artists argue are unfair and lower than what other services pay, over the past few years as well.

So if you want to cancel Spotify, whether for any those reasons or another one altogether, you can follow the instructions below.

How to cancel via web:

1. Log into your Spotify account in your browser.

2. Go to Account in the dropdown menu that shows up when you click on your Profile.

3. Find Cancel Subscription under the Subscription section.

4. Spotify will tell you that you'll hear ads every 15 minutes on a free account, along with the date when your premium access will end. Click "Continue to cancel" at the bottom of the screen.

If you're on mobile, make sure to request the desktop site after you log into your account on your mobile browser. Take note that if you're part of a Spotify Family or Duo plan, only the plan manager will be able to cancel your subscription altogether. If you follow the same steps above as a member, you'll only remove your account from the plan, but the manager will continue paying for it.

How to cancel via third-party provider:

If you pay for your subscription through third-party providers, you can follow these instructions instead.

Cancel via Google

1. Fire up the Google Play app and tap on the icon for the account you use.

Cancel via carrier

Instructions for this may vary, depending on your carrier. Generally, however, you can follow these steps.

1. Log into your carrier account on its website.

2. Find the option to manage your subscriptions under your account.

3. Find Spotify and go through the cancellation process.

What happens after you cancel

You'll still have access to Spotify's premium features until your next billing cycle begins. That means you still won't encounter ads and will have access to offline downloads, as well as unlimited skips and higher audio quality. You'll be able to access your Spotify library even with a free account, but if you want to find another streaming service to pay for, you can check Engadget's list of best music streaming services in 2025.
