Amazon is rolling out a new feature that makes it easier to buy more throughout the week. The company said its now updating its Amazon Shopping app and website with a new addition that lets Prime members add items to upcoming deliveries with one tap, instead of having to create a new order.

The feature is designed to better reflect how people actually shop on Amazon online.
