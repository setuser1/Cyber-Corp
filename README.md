Google says hackers associated with a prolific ransomware group are sending extortion emails to executives at &#8220;numerous&#8221; large organizations after claiming to have stolen their sensitive information from a suite of business software products developed by Oracle.

In a statement provided to TechCrunch, Googles head of cybercrime analysis Genevieve Stark said the hackers began sending emails to executives around September 29, but that the tech giant has not yet substantiated the hackers claims.
