Meta is bringing its AI-powered photo and video editing tools directly to Instagram Stories, allowing users to enter text prompts to add or remove things in photos and videos or even change it completely.

While Meta has already offered image editing capabilities on Instagram, those tools were limited to interactions with the Meta AI chatbot. The addition of text-based prompts in Stories now makes these editing features much more accessible.
