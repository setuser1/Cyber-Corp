TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is just days away, with tickets still available here! And theres no better time to announce that, alongside our flagship event and annual Startup Battlefield 200 competition, were launching a brand-new TechCrunch franchise: Build Mode.

Hosted by Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen, Build Mode is a survival guide for early-stage founders navigating the messy, high-stakes chaos of building a company from scratch. No sugarcoating. No hype. Just candid conversations and tactical advice from the people whove done it before and have the scars (and term sheets) to prove it.
