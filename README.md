At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, Sequoia managing partner Roelof Botha argued that the venture industry isnt an asset class, and that throwing more money into Silicon Valley doesnt lead to better companies.

&#8220;Investing in venture is a return-free risk,&#8221; Botha said during an interview on TechCrunchs Disrupts main stage on Monday. &#8220;Anybody whos studied the capital asset pricing model understands the joke of that. The reason I came up with this is, if you look at the history of venture capital, its an asset thats uncorrelated with other asset classes.&#8221;
