Today, OpenAI launched its new Atlas web browser in a surprise livestream. The show started with CEO Sam Altman, speaking directly to the audience.

“We think AI represents a rare, once-a-decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be,” Altman said. “In the same way that, for the previous way people used the internet, the URL bar and the search box were a great analogue, what were starting to see is that the chat experience and the web browser can be a quick analogue.”
