Dodgers vs. Blue Jays, Game 1 tonight: How to watch the 2025 MLB World Series without cable

The League Championship Series are history, and the final two teams have emerged: The 2025 Fall Classic will see the Los Angeles Dodgers face the Toronto Blue Jays. Game 1 of the 2025 MLB World Series begins tonight — Friday, Oct. 24 — at 8PM ET/5PM PT, with the Blue Jays getting the initial home field advantage at Rogers Centre, Toronto. Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers are aiming to win their second consecutive championship, while Vlad Guerrero Jr. and the Blue Jays are eyeing their first ring since 1993. The World Series odds favor the Dodgers ahead of Game 1. Every 2025 MLB World Series game will air on Fox and Fox Deportes.

Of course, Fox is a "free" over-the-air channel, so any affordable digital antenna will pull in the game if you live close enough to a local affiliate. But if that's not an option, here's a full rundown of how to watch the Dodgers vs. Blue Jays World Series, even without cable.

How to watch the L.A. Dodgers vs. Toronto Blue Jays, Game 1

You can stream Fox on any live TV streaming service that airs Fox local stations, including DirecTV, Fubo and Hulu + Live TV. MLB World Series games will also be available on Fox's new streaming platform, Fox One.

Watch Fox and FS1 on DirecTV

DirecTV

DirecTV gets you access to Fox and FS1, the channels you need to watch the World Series, plus the CW, ABC, CBS, Fox, ACC Network, Big Ten Network, SEC Network and plenty more local regional sports networks.

DirecTV also offers unlimited Cloud DVR storage and access to ESPN+'s new streaming tier, ESPN Unlimited. That's all part of why we named it the best cable TV alternative without a contract.

The best part is that you can try all this out for free for five days. So if you're interested in a live TV streaming service but aren't ready to commit, we recommend starting with DirecTV.

Watch Fox and FS1 on Fubo

Fubo TV

We named Fubo the best live TV streaming service for sports, and it's not just because it's a great place to watch the World Series. Fubo TV gives you access to 100-plus live channels, including Fox and FS1. The cheapest plan starts at $85/month, making the live TV streaming service a significant investment. However, the inclusion of ESPN Unlimited, a $30/month value, is a great deal if you watch sports year-round. Fubo subscribers also get access to unlimited cloud DVR storage.

Currently, the platform is offering a free trial, allowing you to explore everything it has to offer risk-free.
