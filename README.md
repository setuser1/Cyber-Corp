Soras rapid adoption drove a number of App Store scammers to try to get in on the act. Following the launch of OpenAIs invite-only, video-generating mobile app last week, Apples App Store was flooded with fakes that also proclaimed themselves to be &#8220;Sora&#8221; or &#8220;Sora 2&#8221; &#8212; the latter a reference to the underlying new AI video model that was released alongside the mobile app.

These apps somehow made it past Apples App Review process. They actually had public listings on the App Store, despite using a brand name thats trademarked by OpenAI and fairly well known in the tech industry even before the apps debut.
