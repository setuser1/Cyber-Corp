While Black Friday remains the best time to grab a new TV at a discount, Amazons latest October Prime Day sale has been a good opportunity to take the plunge if you need to upgrade right away. We're into the second and final day of the "Prime Big Deal Days" event, but several well-reviewed sets from LG, Samsung, Sony and other name brands remain at or near their lowest prices to date. Weve picked through the best October Prime Day TV deals that are still available below, along with a few choice discounts on streaming devices we like. Just remember that some deals are exclusive to Prime subscribers.

Best Prime Day 4K TV deals

TCL

TCL QM6K 55-inch Mini-LED 4K TV

$448$600Save $152

The TCL QM6K is widely regarded by reviewers we trust as one of the years better TV bargains. Its a value-oriented model, so it wont get you the same level of contrast, color volume or brightness as more expensive sets, nor will it be ideal for HDR content (especially in well-lit rooms). Still, its quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting and full-array local dimming more than hold their own for the price, and it runs on the useful Google TV platform. Its also a nice buy for gaming on a budget, since its input lag is relatively low and it has a native 144Hz refresh rate that can reach as high as 288Hz at 1080p.

This discount is only a dollar more than the lowest price weve seen for the 55-inch version. Other sizes are available for all-time lows, including the 65-inch model for $548 and the 75-inch model for $750.

$448 at Amazon

TCL QM7K 55-inch Mini-LED 4K TV for $570 ($330 off MSRP): If youre willing to stretch your budget a little further, the TCL QM7K is a fairly comprehensive step up, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz support at 1080p, too, though its still limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. (As with the QM6K, however, neither of those is an eARC port, so hooking up a soundbar wont block a game console if you have multiple systems.) This discount represents a new low, beating the previous best mark we've seen by roughly $30.

Hisense U8QG 65-inch Mini-LED 4K TV for $998 ($500 off): Several reviews suggest that the Hisense U8QG ticks most of the requisite boxes for a LCD TV in 2025: robust local dimming and mini-LED backlighting, exceptionally high brightness, vibrant quantum-dot colors, a fast refresh rate (165Hz in this case), support for the major HDR formats and so on. Its a higher-end option than something like the TCL QM6K or QM7K with superior brightness and contrast, though it still falls short of a good OLED TV when it comes to the latter. Like most LCD panels, itll also look a bit washed out if you view it from an angle. It has three HDMI 2.1 ports, which is one fewer than many other TVs in this price range, though it uniquely includes a USB-C video input if you want to hook up a gaming laptop or Nintendo Switch. (Just note that you wont get VRR or HDR when using that.) Youd mainly get it over an OLED TV if youre willing to trade some picture quality for something better-suited in a bright room. This deal on the 65-inch model matches the best price we've tracked.

Samsung S90F 55-inch QD-OLED 4K TV for $1,100 ($498 off): The Samsung S90F is an upper-tier model with a QD-OLED panel, which blends the usual perks of a quality OLED set — near-perfect contrast, wide viewing angles, clear motion, low input lag — with a layer of quantum dots. This helps it produce a wider gamut of more vivid colors compared to traditional WOLED TVs. It also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports and has a fast refresh rate of 144Hz. It doesnt support Dolby Vision HDR, however, and reviews we trust say that the LG C5, a competing WOLED model, retains darker black levels in a bright room. This deal marks a new low for the 55-inch model, while the 65-inch and 77-inch versions are also at all-time lows of $1,598 and $2,298, respectively. Just make sure you only buy the 55-, 65- or 77-inch model, as every other size in the US uses a lesser WOLED panel. Shady, we know.

LG C5 65-inch OLED 4K TV for $1,373 ($1,309 off): The LG C5 cant produce the same bold colors as a QD-OLED display like the Samsung S90F, but reviews almost universally agree that its an exceptional OLED TV otherwise. It should get brighter with non-HDR content, and as noted above it should produce deeper blacks in well-lit environments. It also has just about all the essential gaming features, plus it supports the popular Dolby Vision HDR format (but not HDR10+). If you need that, or if you want an OLED set in this price range for a bright-ish room, its well worth a look. This is nearly an all-time low for the 65-inch model, beating its typical street price by about $125. You should see the full discount at checkout. Other sizes are also on sale, but note that the 42- and 48-inch models cant get as bright as the larger versions.

LG B5 55-inch OLED 4K TV for $997 ($100 off): The B5 is LGs entry-level OLED TV for 2025, and as such its a level below the C5 in terms of brightness and color performance. Its technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz as well, though that isnt a huge deal right now unless you plan on hooking up a gaming PC. If anything, last years LG C4 — which isnt seriously discounted as of this writing — is a better value for most on the whole. But if you just want to save cash, the B5 still provides most of the core benefits of an OLED display at a lower price. This is a new all-time low for the 55-inch variant.

Samsung

Samsung The Frame (2024) 55-inch LED 4K TV

$798$1,498Save $700

Samsungs The Frame series has always been for people who care about their TVs aesthetic more than its picture quality, since its designed to resemble a framed piece of wall art. Its still overpriced for a TV with no local dimming or Dolby Vision HDR, but this deal ties the lowest price weve seen for the 55-inch model, making it at least a little more reasonable. Other sizes are also on sale. Note that this deal is for the 2024 model — this years version is discounted as well, but its panel still isnt great for the price. Wed recommend saving as much cash as possible if you really want one of these things.

$798 at Amazon

Samsung S95F 55-inch QD-OLED 4K TV for $1,998 ($200 off): If youre willing to pay for a top-of-the-line OLED TV, the Samsung S95F should fit the bill. Reviews around the web praise it for being especially bright for an OLED TV while retaining the bold colors and superb contrast youd want from a high-end QD-OLED panel. That brightness combined with the screens matte finish means its particularly adept at fending off glare, so itll be effective in either a dark or bright room. Its also loaded with gaming features, including a 165Hz refresh rate. That said, the matte coating means black levels wont be as deep in a well-lit environment, and theres still no Dolby Vision support. This is the lowest price weve seen for the 55-inch model.

LG G5 55-inch OLED 4K TV for $1,747 ($753 off): The LG G5 competes with the Samsung S95F in the top end of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter than Samsungs model, it supports Dolby Vision and its lack of a matte coating means it wont lose its inky black levels in a bright room. That said, having a glossy finish also means that its more susceptible to direct reflections. And while its picture is a level above most other WOLED TVs, it isnt quite on par with the S95F when it comes to color volume. Still, if youre mainly going to watch things in the dark, it might be the better buy. This is a new low for the 55-inch variant.

Sony Bravia 8 II 65-inch QD-OLED 4K TV for $2,798 ($702 off): Its certainly not cheap, but the Sony Bravia 8 II has earned plaudits for its excellent image processing, upscaling and overall accuracy alongside the expected color, contrast and motion benefits of its QD-OLED display. This should help it make lots of movies and shows look closer to their original intent. It also uses the handy Google TV interface. This deal marks the best price to date for the 65-inch version. That said, if you cant stomach the high price, other reviews note that the older Sony A95L offers similar performance a bit less, while more recent competitors like the LG G5 and Samsung S95F can get noticeably brighter (even if theyre not always as accurate). Those two should be better for gaming as well, as the Bravia 8 II only has two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher.

Sony Bravia 9 75-inch Mini-LED 4K TV for $2,798 ($702 off): The Bravia 9 is Sonys flagship mini-LED TV. Its pricier than many OLED TVs, but most reviews say that it produces better contrast and black levels than the vast majority of non-OLED sets, with minimal light bloom around bright objects onscreen. So its still a strong performer in a dark room. Like the best LCD TVs, it can also get super bright, and it delivers the excellent upscaling and image processing that high-end Sony TVs are known for, so it should make old DVDs and lower-quality streams look their best. That said, the top OLED TVs still have it beat when it comes to contrast, color volume and viewing angles. Its also not the best choice for gaming, since its limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports and has slightly higher input lag than other models. But if money is no object and you dont want to go OLED, it should satisfy. This discount matches the lowest price weve seen for the 75-inch version.

Best Prime Day streaming device deals

Google

Google TV Streamer 4K

$80$100Save $20

The Google TV Streamer 4K is the top recommendation in our guide to the best streaming devices. Its bigger and much more expensive than the old Chromecast even with this discount, but it blends faster hardware with a helpful interface that pulls together content from across services and regularly makes it easy to find (or jump back into) things you might actually watch. It can also work as a smart home hub with support for the Matter and Matter-over-Thread protocols. Its limited to Wi-Fi 5 and lacks hands-free voice control, however. This deal is only $1 more than the lowest price we've seen.

$80 at Amazon

Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $30 ($20 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you prefer a stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if youre partial to Rokus app-centric interface, which many find simpler to navigate than the content-heavy UIs pushed by Google and Amazon. It supports Apple AirPlay and the major HDR formats, and its performance remains quick enough for most. Youll have to deal with some ads, though, and no Roku player supports the Twitch app. This deal is $5 more than the devices all-time low but ties the best price weve seen in several years.

Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $24 ($16 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is cheaper alternative to the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender built in. The latter means it may be less reliable if you dont get a consistent connection in your TVs room. (Both sticks are limited to Wi-Fi 5, though.) That said, this model can typically be powered straight from a TVs USB port instead of requiring a separate power supply. If you can live with the sacrifices, it may not be worth paying extra. This deal represents a new all-time low.

Roku Ultra for $69 ($31 off): Youd buy the Roku Ultra if you want the Roku interface in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the companys streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finder tool and backlit buttons. (You can buy that separately, though.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support. This deal ties an all-time low.

Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off): The standard Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it comes with a slightly slower processor, half the storage (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people just looking for a casual streamer on the cheap, those shouldnt be huge losses. This model is also more powerful than the just-announced Fire TV 4K Select, though its Fire OS interface can still be messy and ad-heavy, with special emphasis on Amazons own services. This deal is $3 more than the sticks all-time low, though it matches the best price weve seen since Black Friday last year.

Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It can only stream up to 1080p, and it can run a bit choppier than the 4K models since it has a slower chipset and half the RAM (1GB). The usual issues with the Fire TV interface still apply here too. But if you just want to add streaming apps to an aging TV or basic monitor for as little cash as possible, it should get the job done. This discount ties the device's lowest price to date.
