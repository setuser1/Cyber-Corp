Amazon's October Prime Day gives you the rare occasion to buy a DJI drone at a discount. The company's popular Neo drone is now available for $159, making an already affordable product even more manageable with a $40 (20 percent) discount. That sum will get you a drone that's very friendly for beginners thanks to features like palm takeoff, but also powerful with subject tracking and even support for FPV flying. You can also grab it with two extra batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off) â€” a deal I'd recommend if you plan to fly a lot.

A rare Prime Day sale makes the affordable DJI Neo drone even more manageable.

The Neo is tiny at just 135 grams so it's exempt from any drone license requirements and small enough to slide into a jacket pocket. At the same time, it's safe around people thanks to the protective propeller guards. Beginners can launch it directly from their palm either by pressing a button or giving a voice command, and it will fly one of six preprogrammed smart shots like Follow, Dronie or Rocket.

The Neo can also be controlled using a smartphone via Wi-Fi or DJI controller, including the RC Motion 3 and even the DJI Goggles 3 for acrobatic FPV flying. It has a very respectable 6.2-mile line-of-sight range and can fly at up to 18 mph, or 36 mph with a special controller. Video quality is very good for such a cheap drone, with up to 4K 30 fps video via the 1/2-inch 12-megapixel sensor and software-based Rocksteady stabilization.

The main drawbacks are the lack of obstacle detection, relatively short 17-minute battery life and banshee-like noise. However, this is a great first drone for creators and other users, particularly at the Prime Day sale price of $159. As mentioned, you can also get iti with three batteries and a charger for $229
