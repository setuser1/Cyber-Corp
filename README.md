Sonos Ace headphones didnt get off to the best start, but the brands first headphones have come a long way since launch, and for $100 off when purchased directly from Sonos or Amazon, theyre well worth considering. The Ace are down to $299 from both retailers, and for that price youre getting one of the most feature-packed pairs of noise-canceling headphones on the market right now.

When the Ace arrived in the summer of 2024, we praised them for their sound quality, premium design and comfy fit, but had no choice but to ding the headphones for not launching with some of their flashiest features. But thats no longer an issue if you pick up a pair today, as Sonos TrueCinema spatial audio tech now works as advertised.

As a reminder, TrueCinema takes into account the dynamics of your living space when youre using TV Audio Swap to create a virtual 3D audio system in your headphones. The idea is that you feel like you arent wearing them at all, which is a big claim to make, but theres no denying that True Cinema enhances the experience of watching movies and TV shows while wearing the Ace.

Sonos has also improved the Aces adaptive noise cancellation in updates made available since launch, while phone calls are now clearer than they were when we first reviewed the headphones. Theyre still expensive at full price, but if you use other Sonos products in your home and think youll appreciate the Aces ability to swap audio output with a compatible Sonos soundbar (ideal for late-night movies when the kids are in bed), then its a very easy recommendation at $299.
