After OpenAIs video-generating app Sora surged to the No. 1 position on the U.S. App Store, it has now, technically, experienced a bigger first week than ChatGPT on iOS, according to new data from app intelligence provider Appfigures. Its estimates show that Sora saw 627,000 iOS downloads in its first seven days of availability, compared with ChatGPTs 606,000 iOS downloads during its first week.

This isnt the fairest comparison, however, because ChatGPT was available only in the U.S. during its first week, while Sora is currently offered in the U.S. and Canada at launch. Still, Appfigures says that Canada contributed about 45,000 installs, so the Sora launch was about 96% of ChatGPTs launch, if the data had been based on the U.S.Â numbers only.
