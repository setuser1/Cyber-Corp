Discord disclosed on Wednesday that around 70,000 users may have had sensitive data &#8212; like their government ID photos &#8212; exposed after hackers breached a third-party vendor that the platform uses for age-related appeals.

A Discord user would make an &#8220;age-related appeal&#8221; if the platform suspects they may be underage, or if they live somewhere that requires identity verification for platform access. In those cases, users are asked to send a selfie holding their government ID and Discord username to the platforms Trust & Safety team.
