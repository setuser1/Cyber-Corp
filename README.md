Amazon is offering a hefty discount on the Ring Battery Doorbell Plus. The video doorbell has dropped from its regular price of $150 to $80 in a limited-time deal.

That's a discount of 47 percent for this particular model. It also matches the record-low price we saw for the Ring Battery Doorbell Plus during the Prime Day event earlier this month.

Amazon says the Battery Doorbell Plus is easy to set up using the Ring app and mounting tools. The company added that there's a quick release system for the battery pack, so you can take it inside for recharging without having to unscrew a cover.

Naturally, the device is connected to the Alexa smart home ecosystem, so you'll be able to receive motion alerts on compatible Echo devices or see a live view of the camera's feed on an Echo Show, Fire TV or Fire Tablet. You'll be able to chat to whoever's at the door too, via the doorbell's two-way communication system.

A Ring Home subscription is required for you to receive package alerts â€” this feature will let you know when the doorbell's camera detects a package within a particular zone. The subscription also includes the option to save recorded videos for up to 180 days, among other features.
