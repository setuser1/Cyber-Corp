Super.money, a financial service platform spun off last year by Walmart-owned Flipkart, has quietly partnered with payments infrastructure firm Juspay as it expands into direct-to-consumer (D2C) checkout and targets $100 million in annual revenue by 2026.

The partnership comes as Juspay works to rebuild momentum after facing pushback from major payment companies earlier this year &#8212; a dispute that complicated its fundraising efforts.
