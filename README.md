Verizon's latest ad defies CRT physics

One does not simply toss a 27-inch set to another human being.

A real Verizon commercial.

(Verizon)

I know there are bigger fish to fry, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't draw your attention to this travesty of a commercial Verizon just released. It's only 30 seconds long but may go down as one of the worst ads I've ever seen.

Whats so offensive, you ask? Well, the carrier (and one-time parent company of Engadget) wants to promote the fact that it will give AT&T and T-Mobile customers a better deal on their wireless plan if they bring in their monthly cellular bill. That's all well and good, but we need to talk about the cathode-ray tube TV that's at the center of the commercial.

The ad opens with a woman walking into a Best Buy-coded store and handing over a 27-inch CRT TV to a nearby sales associate. "Hi, I got this old thing and the bill from the store where I got it," she tells the young salesperson while casually tossing the TV to him. "Figured you could beat it with a better deal on one of these big boys," she adds, pointing to, lets be honest, an objectively worse flat panel TV.

Now, I need to know: did anyone who worked on this commercial try to lift a CRT? Look, I know it's 2025, and even the newest sets are now close to two decades old, but even if you've never seen one in real-life, surely you've heard how heavy they are? If I had to guess, the TV we see in the commercial, which looks like an RCA 27R411T, weighs close to 75 pounds. There's a reason so many Facebook Marketplace listings recommend you bring a friend with you when you come pick up the CRT they're selling; most people can't lift even a mid-sized set on their own.

I hate to think how Verizon made this commercial. CRTs are a dead technology. No company is making new consumer sets anymore, and any working CRTs left out in the world are on borrowed time. If the company gutted a working set to make this commercial, it means theres one less CRT in an ever-dwindling pool. Someone could have enjoyed that TV and stopped it from entering a landfill.

But as for the rest of the commercial, its equally as bad. No big box retailer is accepting trade-ins for a CRT TV, and even if they were, trying to get rid of one that way would be a rookie move. CRTs, both TVs and monitors, are highly sought after by retro gamers. Even a relatively unknown set like the 27R411T can catch a few hundred dollars, especially if it's in pristine condition. In fact, a quick eBay search returns a seller looking for $350 for their 27R411T unit.

But you know what our dear Verizon booster does? She just walks away without the CRT after the salesperson tells her the shop won't give her a better deal on a new TV. "Guess you're not as cool as Verizon" she says, uttering a thing no one in the history has ever said. Sorry, joke's on you, lady. Not only is that TV impossibly light, it's way cooler than anything Verizon has ever done.
