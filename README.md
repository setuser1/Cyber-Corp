ChatGPTs mobile app growth may have hit its peak, according to a new analysis of download trends and daily active users provided by the third-party app intelligence firm Apptopia. Its estimates indicate that new user growth, measured by percentage changes in new global downloads, slowed after April.

The firm looked at the global daily active user (DAU) growth and found that the numbers have begun to even out over the past month or so.
