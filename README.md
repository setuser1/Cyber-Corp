When Fujifilm launched the X-T50 last year, no one was sure what would happen with its aging X-T30 lineup. The company just answered that question with the launch of the X-T30 III, boosting the speed and improving autofocus of the last model, while adding a film simulation dial seen on other recent models. It's very light for travel or street photography, but has some powerful features like 6.2K video and subject-detect autofocus, all at a reasonable price.

The original X-T30 first arrived in 2019 and was replaced in 2022 by the X-T30 II that was more of a mild update than an all-new camera. However, the X-T30 III has a number of key updates that bring it in line with other recent models like the X-M5 and X-T50. It does have the same 26.1MP X-Trans sensor as before (with a 1.5x crop compared to a full-frame camera), but now uses Fujifilm's latest image processor that doubles image processing speed and significantly improves video capabilities.

The X-T30 III is meant to be taken on adventures, so it's still very light at just 378 grams or 13.33 ounces, a touch less than the previous model. Control-wise, the biggest addition is a film simulation dial just like the one on the X-M5 and X-T50, replacing the mode dial from the X-T30 II. It's designed to make it easy to switch between film simulations like Reala Ace and Nostalgic Neg, while offering three customizable positions to let users save "recipes" of their own making.

Otherwise, the X-T30 III has a generous complement of dials and buttons something that allows for precise control but may intimidate newbies. The rear display tilts up but doesn't flip out, and the 2.36-million-dot electronic viewfinder is on the low end for resolution. The main feature missing on the X-T30 III is in-body stabilization, so you'll need either a stabilized (OIS) lens or electronic stabilization for video.

Burst shooting speeds are the same as before at 8 fps with the mechanical shutter and 20 fps in electronic mode. However, more of your shots are likely to be sharp thanks to the updated, faster autofocus. Along with the extra speed, Fujifilm introduced new AI subject detection modes including Auto-Tracking, Animals, Birds and Vehicles.

Video also gets a big upgrade. The X-T30 III can now shot 6.2K 30 fps video using the entire sensor (up from 4K 30p before), or 4K at 60 fps with a mild 1.18x crop. All of those resolutions are available with 10-bit modes to boost dynamic range. However, the X-T30 III lacks in-body stabilization, has a weird 2.5mm microphone input and a display that only tilts and doesn't flip out. That makes it fine as a hybrid camera, but if you mostly shoot video, a model like the X-S20 may be a better choice.

Other key features include a microHDMI port for RAW video output, a single SD memory card (that's of the low-speed UHS-I variety unfortunately), and improved battery life with up to 425 shots to a charge. Fujifilm also introduced a new lens, the Fujinon XC13-33mmF3.5-6.3 OIS that offers an interesting ultrawide full-frame equivalent zoom range of around 20-50mm.
