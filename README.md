Amazon's Prime Day sale is a great time to save money on new kitchen tools — but there are only a few hours left to do so. We've combed through the thousands of deals on cooking gadgets and appliances to find the best deals on kitchen tech we've tested and recommend in our reviews and buyer's guides. We found deals on some of our top picks for rice cookers, Instant Pots, Kitchen Aid tools, air fryers and of course, the frozen dream-maker, Ninja's Creami ice cream maker. Most of these discounts will expire tonight when the sale ends, so if one of these Prime Day kitchen deals catches your eye, you may want to get it now.

The best Prime Day kitchen deals

Cuckoo

CUCKOO 6-Cup Twin Pressure Rice Cooker

$190$300

Save $110 with Prime

Cuckoo Twin Pressure Rice Cooker for $190 ($70 off with Prime): This is the best premium rice cooker in our guide to those machines. We like how quickly it cooks all types of rice to perfection (we tested it with long-grain white basmati, brown and sushi-grade white rice). Just keep in mind that it can be a little difficult to clean and the manual isnt the most user-friendly.

KitchenAid Artisan Series Stand Mixer for $379 ($121 off): Theres a reason this is so popular among home bakers and chefs. The Artisan KitchenAid is sort of the gold standard stand mixer, as we point out in our guide to the best kitchen tech. This isnt an all-time low (it was $350 as recently as May), but matches the July Prime Day price.

Ninja Slushi for $300 ($50 off): We havent officially tested this one just yet, but given our love of both the Creami and the Creami Swirl, its a fair bet that this one will do good things with cold stuff too. This is the lowest price of the year so far.

Cosori 9-in-1 TurboBlaze Air Fryer for $90 ($30 off with Prime): This is the runner up pick in our air fryer buying guide. We appreciate the roomy basket and easy-to-use touchscreen. Its missing the clear front window that our top pick from Instant has but, unlike that one, the Cosori has a release button on the basket which is a welcome safety feature.

Vitamix 2-Speed Immersion Blender for $90 ($40 off with Prime): For quick sauces and soups, we like this nifty two-speed hand blender from Vitamix, and said so in our guide to cheap kitchen gadgets. It even comes with a whisk for making your own whipped cream.

Ninja Dual Foodie Zone Air Fryer (DZ302) for $160 ($70 off): If you want to air fry two different things at the same time, this is the one to get. This is the same in specs, capacity and wattage as our top pick for a dual-zone air fryer, just with a different model number. It even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time.

Vitamix 5-Speed Immersion Blender for $200 ($100 off with Prime): If you want a little extra oomph from your hand blender, grab this one. We named it the best counter top replacement model in our guide to the best immersion blenders. The 625 watt motor is more powerful than most and the blender head is intelligently designed to reduce suction and prevent scratches plus it fits inside a wide mouth mason jar.

Ninja Creami ice cream maker $180 ($50 off): This is one of our favorite pieces of kitchen tech and we called it a frozen fantasy-maker in our review. Note that the Creami dipped down to $160 last Black Friday but this matches the lowest price we've seen this year.

Instant Pot Vortex Plus with Clear Cook for $80 ($20 off with Prime): This Vortex air fryer model is similar to our top airfryer pick, but is missing the Odor Ease feature. It still has the Clear Cook window that lets you keep an eye on your food as it crisps and the Vortex cooking tech heats up remarkably fast, with almost no pre-heating time.

Meater Pro wireless thermometer for $99 ($31 off with Prime): This was previously called the Meater 2 Plus, but the company changed the name. We gave it high praise in our review, and like the extended range, strong battery life, durability and precision.

Fellow Stagg EKG Pro Electric Gooseneck Kettle for $144 ($36 off with Prime): This is one of the appliances we recommend in our guide for tea gifts. I bought one based on that suggestion and have been impressed with this little kettles speed and good looks ever since.

ooni

Ooni Koda 12 Gas pizza oven & peel bundle

$344$429

Save $85 with Prime

Ooni Koda 12 Gas Pizza Oven & Peel Bundle for $344 ($85 off with Prime): Ooni makes some of our favorite pizza ovens. This bundle includes the indispensable pizza peel and a propane-powered unit that can heat up to 950 degrees in 15 minutes.

$344 at Amazon

Instant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $60 ($70 off with Prime): Heres a smaller version of our best overall air fryer. This one has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly thanks to a 1600-watt output.

KitchenAid Variable Speed Corded Hand Blender for $55 ($15 off): We recommend the cordless version of this immersion blender in our guide to those appliances. This corded version has the same variable speed trigger which makes it easy to control your recipes. Note that this sold for $5 less as recently as May.

Breville Joule Turbo Sous Vide Machine for $200 ($50 off): This is the premium pick from our guide to sous vide machines. It has a powerful 1,100-watt heater and a Turbo mode that significantly reduces cooking times. But there are no built-in controls — youll have to use your phone and Brevilles free app to use it.

AeroPress Original for $30 ($10 off): Were fans of AeroPress portable coffee makers and recommend the pricer Go Plus model in our guide to coffee gifts. If you dont want to spend quite so much, grab the original model, which is even cheaper for Prime Day.

Breville InFizz Fusion beverage maker for $200 ($50 off): We called this fizz-maker the bubble master in our review. True, its pricier than rivals in the same space, but the upscale design — that actually looks good on a countertop — somewhat makes up for the price premium. We also appreciate the Fusion Cap that helps prevent messy eruptions when youre bubbling up your drinks.

Hamilton Beach Digital Rice Cooker for $37 ($13 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is great for small kitchens (but probably not for big families). We thought it outperformed other cookers that are four times the price, though its not the best for all-day warming of rice as the bottom bigs got a little overdone.

Cosori Air Fryer Pro Compact for $85 ($15 off with Prime): One of our concerns with the Cosori 9-in-1 was that it was a little on the wide side, taking up extra countertop space. The Pro Compact has a more space-saving design while still packing a five-quart basket.

Instant Pot 4QT Vortex mini air fryer for $55 ($35 off with Prime): This models four-quart capacity falls between our top Instant Pot air fryer pick and the budget model. It has the Clear Cook window feature, six presets and it comes in pink in addition to the standard white and black.

Instant Pot Duo Plus for $70 ($70 off with Prime): We named this the best multicooker in our guide to the best kitchen tech weve tested. It can cook a dizzying array of foods from basic beans and rice to homemade yogurt. We like this one because its simple to use, and has quick-cooking modes for soup, eggs and grains. Theres even a sous vide cooking function.

Breville Bambino Plus for $400 ($100 off): In our gift guide for coffee lovers, this espresso machine earned our respect for its compact size and the fact that it doesnt cost a grand, like some machines do. Plus the controls are easy for beginners to learn but makes silky milkfoam for pro-level latte artists.

Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $120 ($30 off): This went as low as $110 back in January, but its still a decent discount on a high-powered juice extractor. We were won over by its impressive juicing abilities and despite how it looks, it's surprisingly easy to clean — as long as you do it right away.

Ninja 5.5-quart Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) for $130 ($50 off with Prime): This one earned an honorable mention in our guide to air fryers. Its double the capacity of our budget pick and has a dehydrate preset. While we found the round basket a little cramped, we liked how the fryers vertical design saved counter space. Just note that this went as low as $90 in July.

Vitamix Explorian E310 Blender for $330 ($50 off): This isnt the best deal weve seen this year — this Vitamix dropped to $300 as recently as May. But if youre in the market for a blender that can turn the most recalcitrant nut into the creamiest butter, we think this wont let you down.
