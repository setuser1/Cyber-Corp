Google's Gemini will now generate presentations for you

You can either write a prompt or upload your own sources.

Google is rolling out out a new feature for Gemini's Canvas, the free interactive workspace inside the AI chatbot's app, meant for students and employees who need to create presentations. Gemini is now capable of generating slides with just a prompt, though users can also upload files like documents, spreadsheets and research papers if they want a presentation based on a specific source. If the source doesn't matter, users can write a prompt, such as "Upload any source to create a presentation on [a specific topic]," for instance. But if the source is essential, they can upload the file first and then ask Gemini to create the presentation for them.

The resulting decks already have a theme and images attached with the text. Users will be able to export them straight from the Gemini app into Google Slides, though, and will still be able to edit and refine the decks as needed or work on it in collaboration with a teammate. The capability is now making its way to both personal and Workspace accounts.

Google launched Canvas in March for people to use when they want to share their writing or code to Gemini for editing. If users put in code or prompts for projects like apps, web pages and infographics, Canvas will be able to show them a visual representation of their design.
