Violent video games have found themselves in the crosshairs of politicians yet again, but this time with Mexico's government. Earlier this week, Mexico's Chamber of Deputies approved a comprehensive financial package that includes an eight percent tax on video games with mature content. As first reported by Insider Gaming, the proposed tax covers games that have a C or D rating under Mexico's video game age classification system, which is similar to ESRB in the US. The C rating is for players who are at least 18 years old and allows for extreme violence, bloodshed and moderate graphic sexual content, while the D rating is reserved for adults only and allows for prolonged scenes that include similar content.

The proposed law was first introduced in September, when the country's Treasury Department claimed that "recent studies have found a relationship between the use of violent video games and higher levels of aggression among adolescents, as well as negative social and psychological effects such as isolation and anxiety." The report cited a study from 2012 in a footnote, which also observed some positive associations with video games, including motor learning and building resilience.

The current interpretation of the proposal that's been approved by the Chamber of Deputies would apply to digital and physical copies of affected games, as well as any in-game purchases or microtransactions. The proposal still has to go through Mexico's other congressional chamber, the Senate, where it will be debated before a November 15 deadline to submit a budget proposal.
