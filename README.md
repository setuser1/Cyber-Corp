Apple TV 4K and remote

Its been an interesting few months in the realm of streaming service branding. Warner Bros. Discovery reverted Max back to HBO Max after a baffling decision to trim the name in the first place. Disney made Hulu the "global general entertainment brand" on Disney+ when it rebranded the Star hub on the service. Now Apple would like you to know that its changing the name of its streaming service too. Going forward, Apple TV+ is now just Apple TV.

The company revealed the news in very lowkey fashion, at the end of a press release about when its F1 movie will land on Apple TV, the streaming service with a monthly subscription (December 12, FYI). “Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity,” the company said without elaborating.

Apple does like to keep things clean, and shearing off the plus sign is one way of doing that. But oversimplification can cause greater confusion.

As Apple states in its own press release, “Apple TV is available on the Apple TV app” and “For a limited time, customers who purchase and activate a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or Mac can enjoy three months of Apple TV for free.” Did no one at Apples (generally very effective) marketing team spot the problem with this? Buying Apple TV to get free Apple TV sounds like a recursive capitalist fever dream that will never end.

As it stands, you can turn on your Apple TV device to open the Apple TV app to watch Apple TV. There are lots of things in the Apple TV app that arent actually Apple TV shows or movies and you may have to pay for those separately. The press release also states that you can watch F1 right now if you buy it on Apple TV through the Apple TV app, so you dont have to wait for the film to make its “global streaming debut” on Apple TV. What a mess.

Apple hasnt fully rolled out the change yet, as there are still plenty of references to “Apple TV+” on the streaming services website. Its still referred to as Apple TV+ on the TV apps listing on the App Store too. Im interested to see how confusing things really get if, in the coming months, Apple reveals a refreshed Apple TV. You know, that device you can use to watch Apple TV.
