Despite coming out just a couple of weeks ago, the Apple Watch Series 11 is already discounted at Amazon. You can pick up one of the smartwatches for $10 off, starting at $389 right now. Apple revealed the latest generation of its wearable at its iPhone 17 event in Cupertino.

The Series 11 packs some new features like 5G connectivity on cellular models, a more scratch-resistant screen, new sleep features, improved battery life and a hypertension alert system that just received FDA clearance. The GPS-only version is our top pick for Best Apple Watch in 2025.

In our hands-on review, we gave the Apple Watch Series 11 a score of 90 out of 100, noting its thin and light design, the excellent battery life, a nifty new wrist-flick gesture and its comprehensive approach to health and fitness monitoring. It is relatively pricey however, and the Watch SE 3 is probably enough for most users, but the Series 11 has a brighter and larger display, a thinner design, longer battery life and more advanced health features.

For anyone who hasn't bought a new Apple Watch in a few years, the Series 11 is a worthy upgrade. If you're in the market for your first Apple Watch, then this model would be a great one to start with. If you're rocking a Series 10, then you probably don't need to upgrade now unless the improved battery life will mean that much to you.

If your budget is tighter and you don't mind getting a slightly older model, you can save on the Apple Watch Series 10 and SE 2. The former is on sale for $329, while the latter is down to only $189.
