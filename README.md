Ron Conway, the founder of venture firm SV Angel, known for its early investments into Google, Airbnb, and Meta, has resigned from the Salesforce Foundation, the New York Times reported. The resignation follows Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff saying last week that he “fully supported” President Trump and proposing that National Guard troops should patrol San Francisco streets to combat crime and homelessness.

In an interview with the New York Times last week, Benioff argued that San Francisco needs &#8220;a show of force&#8221; and called for deploying the National Guard to address what he described as the citys deteriorating conditions. He also praised Elon Musks government efficiency efforts and said that he wasnt keeping up with reports on immigration raids or Trumps attacks on the press, despite owning the news magazine Time, which he purchased in 2018.
