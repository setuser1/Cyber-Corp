Ball x Pit's deeply satisfying grind keeps me coming back for more

The genre-fusing roguelite takes a while to get going, but the dopamine rush doesn't get old.

Ball x Pit

(Kenny Sun/Devolver Digital)

For as long as I can remember, I've had trouble going to sleep. When I lay down, my mind inevitably starts racing a thousand miles an hour, thinking about anything and everything.

On several recent nights, though, my pre-slumber thoughts had a singular focus. I mulled over possibilities like, "What if I fuse a ball that heals my character with one that splits into smaller balls with the same effect, and add a passive that fires a baby ball every time I'm healed?" Then I grab my PlayStation Portal and do just that until I doze off. This is the hold Ball x Pit has had over me.

Kenny Sun and a small group of collaborators have cooked up a mesmerizing brick-breaking roguelite. Ball x Pit is a blend of dual-stick shoot-'em-up action, base building and about a dozen other things that keeps calling me back for one more run... and another, and another.

After a cataclysmic event wipes out the city of Ballbylon and leaves an enormous pit, hunters descend into the depths in search of treasure. For our purposes, this means playing levels to collect resources in order to build structures in New Ballbylon. These buildings unlock perks, such as new characters, that help with future runs. The sickly chaos of the levels and the calmer city building aspect feed into each other smartly and combine for a satisfying loop.

Thats not the only important interplay here. Like any good roguelite, Ball x Pit is all about finding synergies for maximum impact. It's right there in the title, with the "x" denoting a relationship between two things (it's derived from shipping in fandom parlance).

In the pit, you battle monsters by — surprise! — firing balls at them. Along with regular “baby balls,” each character has a unique ability and a special starter ball. In the vein of Vampire Survivors, you'll unlock more special balls and passive abilities when you collect enough gems to level up. One ball has a chance to freeze enemies and another is slower but deals much more damage. There are dozens of others.

The real fun comes in when you start fusing these balls and their effects together, freeing up space for another weapon. It gets even better when you're able to evolve a pair of balls into something new. It's possible to fuse evolved balls, or even evolve them again. Theres a strategic aspect to this, as you wont want to fuse balls that can nearly cancel each other out, such as merging an area-of-effect ball with one that disappears on impact, or leave yourself with too few balls in the face of danger.

Once I unlocked the option to take two characters on a run and combine their passive abilities, that's where things went into overdrive. The possibilities became very exciting at this point, and I ended up playing Ball x Pit way past my ideal bedtime as a result.

It does take a while to get to that point, though. Progression is slow at first. The repetition can get to be a little much as you need to beat each stage multiple times before moving onto the next. Also, I wish there was a bit more to the game narratively than a basic setup and some character descriptions.

But there's so much to consider on each run, and thats what keeps me coming back. Each of the nine levels is set in a different biome, with its own hazards, enemies and bosses. Some late-game characters turn the game on its head by shifting playstyles in surprising ways, but I don't want to spoil those. Along with the absolute chaos and dopamine hits of slicing through enemies, discovering killer combinations between characters, special balls — especially the evolutions — and passives drives so much of the joy of this game.

Whenever you do fuse or evolve a pair of balls, rather than having to click an "OK" button to get back in the action, the prompt reads "Whoa." That's on the nose, but funny. And I'll be damned if I didn't say that very thing out loud many times when I saw what a new evolved ball could do.

Ball x Pit is out now on Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch for $15. It's available via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. A Nintendo Switch 2 version is coming later this fall with a free upgrade from the Switch version.
