The Federal Trade Commission has removed three blog posts from the Lina Khan era that addressed open source AI and risks of AI to consumers, according to a Wired report.

One post, titled “On Open-Weights Foundation Models,” was published July 10, 2024. Another, titled “Consumers Are Voicing Concerns About AI,” came out in October 2023. A third, authored by Khans staff, was published on January 3, 2025, with the title “AI and the Risk of Consumer Harm.” That post noted the FTC was “taking note of AIs potential for real-world instances of harm — from incentivizing commercial surveillance to enabling fraud and impersonation to perpetuating illegal discrimination.”
