Corporate travel management company Navan &#8212; once known as TripActions &#8212; filed updated IPO documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, even though the federal government is currently shut down.

Navan is proceeding under new SEC rules that allows wanna-be public companies that are in limbo during the shutdown to file updated information, including share count and pricing, and have their statements automatically okayed in 20 days without staff scrutiny. Once the filings are declared effective, Navan can kick off its roadshow. The rule, however, doesnt mean that staff cant ask questions or require amended filings later.
