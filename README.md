Dont expect to play your whole library, though.

Its been quite the week for Xbox news. A lot of people are still coming to terms with Microsoft's veritable gut-punch of an announcement that the price of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription is about to soar by 50 percent. And if that has already pushed you into washing your hands with Xbox altogether, it looks like Microsoft may soon attempt to tempt you back by giving away its cloud gaming service for free. That is, an extremely limited version of it, with ads.

According to The Verge, Microsoft is preparing to announce an ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, which finally exited beta this week. Sources said to be familiar with Microsofts strategy told The Verge that game streaming with ads is already being tested internally with employees. Youll reportedly be able to play select games that you own as well as a selection of Xbox Retro Classics titles. Microsoft will also offer Free Play Days games, an initiative that already lets Xbox users try games over a weekend. All of this will be possible without a paid Game Pass subscription.

But the inevitable catch, beyond the restricted catalogue of available games, is that you could have to watch up to several minutes of ad content before getting into a game, and it sounds like there are a number of time-based restrictions as well. Its currently being tested with a one-hour time limit, up to five times per month, though that could change come launch.

Microsoft could launch its ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming tier in beta soon, and it will reportedly be available on PC, Xbox, handheld devices and on browsers. What isnt clear is what streaming quality will be offered on the free version. Xbox Cloud Gamings recently-unlocked 1440p option is going to be exclusive to Game Pass Ultimate, with Microsoft saving the "best quality" streaming for its most expensive plan. Youll be capped at 1080p on the Premium and Essential tiers.

All three paid Game Pass tiers include unlimited cloud gaming, but wait times get longer the further down you go. Its fair to assume that any free cloud service not tied to Game Pass will be hit with longer wait times, though perhaps the enforced ads would hide those pretty well anyway.
