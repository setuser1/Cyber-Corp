An app called Young Minds wants to give parents control over what their kids do on the internet, while also protecting their childrens privacy and teaching them good online habits.

The startup was founded by Nino Dvalidze (pictured), an entrepreneur and a mother of two from the United Kingdom. Dvalidze told TechCrunch that the idea for Young Minds came from conversations with fellow parents, who are also worried about how to keep their children safe, while also allowing them to have access to the internet, which, she admitted, is “enormously helpful in terms of education and exploration and connection with so many people outside of your immediate zone of contacts.”
