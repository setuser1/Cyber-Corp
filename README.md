Its all in the screws.

When Google announced the Pixel Watch 4, it made a point to mention that the smartwatch was "designed with serviceability in mind." Now that it's out, the repair experts at iFixit have taken a look and can confirm Google's claims. The how-to specialist site has called the Pixel Watch 4 the most repairable smartwatch you can buy right now. Thats notable, as iFixit points out, because youd probably expect a sustainability-oriented brand such as Fairphone or Framework to be getting this kind of recognition ahead of Google. (That said, the Fairphone 6 did recently receive a perfect 10/10 repairability review.) But iFixit said it was "truly impressed" with what owners can do to fix Googles latest wearable on their own.

​​

The first thing it highlights is the presence of visible screws that dont interfere with the watchs IP68 water and dust resistance rating. Both the vibration motor and battery are also easy to remove, the latter being glue-free and requiring you only to unscrew from its enclosure. As for the display, thats also secured by screws alone (spotting a pattern here yet?) and sealed using a replaceable O-ring gasket that you can easily purchase. iFixit notes that its harder for square watches to use the same solution, so Googles decision to make the Pixel Watch 4 round boosts its repairability.

At the end of its comprehensive video, iFixit awards Google a provisional rating of 9/10 for repairability, calling it "the most satisfying smartwatch teardown" it has performed to date. For transparency, the site points out that it does have an ongoing business partnership with Google, but insists its completely unrelated to the teardown treatment it gives the Pixel Watch 4.

Its perhaps surprising level of repairability isnt the only thing in the Pixel Watch 4s favor. In Engadgets 86/100 review of the device, Cherlynn Low also praised its rapid charging speeds, excellent health and fitness tracking credentials and attractive display.
