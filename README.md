Battlefield 6 is getting a free battle royale mode on October 28. This follows numerous leaks that have been popping up ever since the mainline game hit store shelves on October 10.

It's called Battlefield: RedSec, though we don't have too many gameplay details. It's free for everyone and you don't need the full-priced game to play. That much we do know. This puts it in direct competition with Call of Duty's own free-to-play battle royale, Warzone.

Eyes up.

We can assume some gameplay elements, as it's a battle royale. It'll likely feature players heading to a large map and battling one another until the last person is left standing. You know the drill. EA dropped a short teaser that seems to show four different classes of soldier to choose from.

We don't know how or if this battle royale will interact with the main game. Warzone typically includes a story that ties into whatever's going on with Call of Duty's seasonal content drops. To that end, Season 1 of Battlefield 6 also releases on October 28. This update includes new maps, modes, vehicles, guns, attachments and cosmetic items.

Battlefield: RedSec will be available for download on various gaming platforms at 11AM ET. This could end up being a pretty big hit for EA, as the main game managed to sell 7 million copies in three days.
