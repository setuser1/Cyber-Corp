In the last few years, photo-sharing apps have capitalized on the idea that Instagram has become too curated, creating spaces for users to share unfiltered photos from their camera rolls. Locket tapped into lockscreen-based sharing, Retro took a photo journaling route, and Yope is building Instagram for private groups.

Now, Mayank Bidawatka, co-founder of Indian social network Koo, which was shut down last year after collapsed buyout talks, is releasing a new photo-sharing app called PicSee. The app, released Thursday, both on iOS and Android, aims to automatically detect and share photos of friends that are in your camera roll without you having to use any messaging system like WhatsApp or Instagram.

Bidawatka said that your friends probably have hundreds of photos of you that you dont have. Either they forgot to send you those photos, or they themselves have forgotten about those photos. PicSee scan faces in your camera gallery and picks out photos of your friends.
