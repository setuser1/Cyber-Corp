Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd gen) review: Impactful upgrades to a familiar formula

The company didn't give us an entirely new model this year, but that's okay.

Bose took a different approach with its new products in 2025. Instead of entirely redesigning  its QuietComfort Ultra lineup, the company unveiled upgraded second-generation models of the flagship-level earbuds and headphones. Like the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds that debuted earlier this year, the new Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones ($449) dont offer a comprehensive overhaul. However, the changes provide enough performance improvements to further cement these as the best noise-canceling headphones that you can buy right now. Trust me, were much better off with this revamped version than we would be with a year (or longer) wait for something brand new with the 2023 model.

Whats new on the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones?

Bose debuted a few new features on the second-gen QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds in August that it carried over to these new headphones. First, the company improved its already stellar active noise cancelation (ANC) with tweaks to its ActiveSense technology. Specifically, the system can respond to sudden spikes in environmental noise by adapting more precisely. Its not something youll notice all the time, but when you need it, youll be glad it's there. Otherwise, the excellent ANC performance here is just as effective as it was on the previous model. More on that in a bit.

The immersive Cinema Mode that Bose added to the QC Ultra Earbuds is also available on these headphones. Its a sound profile that enhances dialogue clarity while keeping the rest of the soundstage as wide and enveloping as possible. I like it best for movies and TV, as the name suggests, but per Boses suggestion I also tried it with podcasts and audiobooks. Cinema Mode is probably overkill for those types of content, unless youre listening to shows or titles with lots of background effects.

One of the biggest changes on the second-gen QC Ultra Headphones is how Bose decided to handle power management. Most importantly, the company extended battery life in all use cases. With ANC on (and Immersive Audio off), youll get up to 30 hours of listening time. Turn off ANC and that jumps to 45 hours. When you decide to enable both ANC and Boses spatial Immersive Audio, you can expect up to 23 hours on a charge. Compared to those on the first-generation model, all of these numbers are up by at least five hours, which is a significant boost.

These headphones rotate flat and fold in for compact transport.

Like the previous QC Ultra Headphones, this model has an automatic disconnection feature after 10 minutes of standby . But the company went a step further on this version by adding a low-power mode that the headphones enter after 30 minutes of idle time. And if you want to disconnect them quickly, you can rotate the earcups and lay them on a flat surface. Thatll make them go into a deeper standby mode that Bose says can run “for months.” All of this means you can effectively turn the new QuietComfort Ultra Headphones on and off by putting them on and taking them off. If youre using them regularly, youll never have to press the power button.

Sound-wise, the big upgrade on these headphones is the addition of lossless audio over USB-C. Like the AirPods Max, this model can be connected with a cable to your phone, tablet, laptop or desktop to stream or play higher-quality tunes from compatible services or your library. Bose says you can expect 16-bit 44.1kHz or 48kHz audio depending on your source. Its yet another nice-to-have feature thats becoming standard fare on premium wireless headphones.

What else is good about the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones?

Like most Bose over-ear headphones, the second-gen QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are supremely comfortable. Even for long periods of time, they never become a burden, and thats thanks in large part to the soft, pillowy ear pads. I could easily wear these for an entire trans-Atlantic flight with minimal discomfort and Ive been wearing them for entire workdays at home.

As I already mentioned, the ANC performance here is still top-tier. In fact, these QC Ultra Headphones will soon replace the first-gen model on our best noise-canceling headphones list. Both the Immersion (ANC + spatial audio) and Quiet (just ANC) modes provide robust noise blocking that surpasses those by Sony, Sennheiser and others. If youre making your buying decision based solely on ANC performance, this is the best option. Youll enjoy relief from constant ambient noise sources like fans and sound machines, plus the QC Ultra Headphones do a respectable job with human voices. Heck, I couldnt even hear my dog barking at the imminent threat from falling leaves outside.

Lastly, Boses take on spatial audio is still quite good. The company calls it Immersive Audio and the feature doesnt rely on specialized content like other headphones. Music sounds obviously fuller and slightly louder when the sound profile is active thanks to Boses method for upscaling stereo content. Theres also enhanced vocal clarity and elements like percussion and synths are less compressed than usual. The headphones lend a particularly airy feel to the tracks of Ruston Kellys Pale, Through the Window, an acoustic-driven collection of soulful, country-tinged tunes. His vocals float atop enveloping acoustic guitars and tight, punchy drums.

Whats not so good about the QC Ultra Headphones?

The biggest issue with the second-gen QuietComfort Ultra Headphones is the price. To be clear, the likes of Sony, Apple and others charge around the same amount for their top-of-the-line models, but $449 is still a significant investment. If thats too steep for you, Bose has the highly capable QuietComfort Headphones in its arsenal for a slightly more palatable $359.

My other gripe is that the only real design change Bose made for the updated QC Ultra Headphones is that the metal headband yokes now have a gloss finish. Depending on your personal preference, this might be a dealbreaker for you. Its least noticeable on the black and violet colorways, since these have a tone-on-tone look. After a few weeks with the bronze and tan Driftwood Sand hue, Im not a fan of the more stylized aesthetic. Its flashy, for sure, but its a tweak I couldve done without.

Wrap-up

Similar to the second-gen QC Ultra Earbuds over the summer, Bose didnt make huge upgrades for the updated version of the QC Ultra Headphones. But what you do get here is a decent improvement over its predecessor. The company devised an intuitive setup for power management and even addressed one of my main gripes with the original by adding support for lossless audio over USB-C. Plus, the extended battery life is significant in all sound modes, and not just by an hour or two here or there. To top it all off, the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones remain the best option for pure noise-blocking ability, and thats not likely to change any time soon.

Bose's stellar ANC continues to get even better.

The new QC Ultra Headphones look almost exactly like the original version, except for some added shine.

Controls are situated along the edge of the right ear cup, including a touch slider for volume.

These headphones rotate flat and fold in for compact transport.

The glossy look probably won't appeal to everyone.

In addition to the shiny finish on the headband yokes, the Bose logos are glossy too.

Bose also managed to extend battery life as every sound mode has more listening time.
