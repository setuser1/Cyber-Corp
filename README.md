We can finally answer the question of who wins in a fight between prime Aang and prime Korra. Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game, which is a working title, was announced at New York Comic Con and already has a release date of summer 2026. The developer, Gameplay Group International, revealed a trailer with some "pre-alpha footage" that resembles Street Fighter but with our favorite characters from the Avatar franchise.

According to the Steam page, the game will offer 12 characters at launch and introduce more on a seasonal basis. While the gameplay still looks like a rough draft, the developer has already detailed a unique fighting system, which includes a "flow system" and support characters that enable special moves. Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game will also have the "energy of classic fighting games" and was made with a focus on "fluidity, responsiveness, and online integrity." Along with combo trials and a gallery mode, the game will have crossplay and be available on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X and S, Nintendo Switch 2 and Steam.

For those not passionate about fighting games, the upcoming release will also feature some original content through its single-player campaign. Alternatively, you can wait for Paramount's "AAA RPG" based on the cartoon with no concrete release date. As for Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game, there's a lot of promise here with the franchise's diverse cast of characters and the developer's experience with other fighting games. At the very least, it's not the same developer that gave us the very forgettable Avatar: The Last Airbender - Quest for Balance game.
