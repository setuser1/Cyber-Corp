Choosing the best laptop can be a bit of a challenge — there are so many models, sizes and specs out there that its easy to feel lost in the shuffle. But the good news is that modern laptops are better than ever. Whether you're looking for a powerful AI PC, a travel-ready ultrabook or an affordable machine that can handle everyday tasks, there's something out there for everyone. Todays systems combine improved performance, longer battery life and smarter features in sleek, lightweight designs that are built to keep up with work, play and everything in between.

Out of all of the notebooks we've tested and reviewed recently, we consider Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air M4 to be the best laptop for most people, and this is still the case for our top picks to start off the new year. It's powerful enough to handle most tasks (even light video editing); it has a great screen and built-in speakers; and its battery could last over 18hours (depending on what you're doing, of course). The MacBook Air M4 is also one of the lightest and thinnest systems we've reviewed, and it's dead silent, thanks to a fanless design.

Of course, not everyone wants a MacBook, and there are excellent Windows laptops and Chromebooks out there, too. Windows systems offer a range of configurations, from budget to high-end UHD screens with stunning IPS panels that boast high nits for vivid brightness. Chromebooks, on the other hand, tend to be more affordable and are great for users who mostly work online. Whether you need a powerhouse for creative work, a compact system for note-taking, or a laptop that can handle family movie night, theres something for everyone in todays laptop market.

Best laptop overall

MacBook Air M4

Read our full Apple MacBook Air M4 review

Display: Liquid Retina | Screen size: 13.6 inches | Screen refresh rate: 60Hz | CPU: 8-core M4 | Processor speed: 4.05 GHz | GPU: Up to 10-core | Installed memory: Up to 24GB | Storage: Up to 2TB | Weight: 2.7 lb | Battery life: More than 18 hours | Dimensions: 0.44 x 11.97 x 8.46 inches | Available ports: MagSafe 3 charging, 3.5mm headphone jack, 2x Thunderbolt 4

Apples M4-equipped 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air remain the best ultraportables you can buy today, and now theyre also better deals starting at $999 and $1,199, respectively. Thats $100 off the previous generation, but its no knock on the quality of these laptops.

Both MacBook Air models remain remarkably fast, incredibly thin and light, and deliver excellent battery life. Theyre basically everything youd want in a premium productivity notebook. Sure, it would be nice to see more than two USB-C ports and a screen thats faster than 60Hz, but most buyers likely wont notice these deficiencies. (And if they really bug you, you can always consider the 14-inch MacBook Pro.)

While the MacBook Airs design hasnt changed from the 2022-era M2 model, its still attractive today, and it also holds up well against Windows ultraportables. The Air isnt Apples fastest computer, but its one of the companys most iconic machines, one thats elegantly crafted in ways that PC makers rarely accomplish. Its smooth metal case still feels great to hold, and its thin and light design makes it easy to travel with. The 2.7-pound 13-inch Air still feels impressively sturdy for its weight, and the 3.2-pound 15-inch model doesnt feel that much heavier. (And for many, the larger screen is worth the portability sacrifice.)

Both MacBook Air models lasted for well over 18 hours in our tests, so theyll likely last you two work days without needing to be juiced up. And while theyre far from gaming PCs, we were still impressed to see them run the graphically intensive game Lies of P at 60fps in 1080p.

Pros

Fast performance

Thin and light design

Great keyboard

Best-in-class touchpad

Excellent battery life

Cons

Could use more ports

Screen is only 60Hz

Best Windows laptop overall

Dell 14 Premium

Display: Touch 3.2K OLED InfinityEdge | Screen size: 14.5 inches | Screen refresh rate: 120Hz | CPU: Intel Core Ultra 7 | Processor speed: 5.1 GHz | GPU: Intel Arc | Installed memory: Up to 32GB | Storage: Up to 1TB | Weight: 3.6 lb | Battery life: Up to 8.5 hours (as tested) | Dimensions: 0.71 x 8.5 x 12.6 inches | Available ports: 3x Thunderbolt 4, 1x audio jack, 1x microSD card slot

Read our full Dell 14 Premium review

For 2025, Dell rebranded the XPS 14 into the 14 Premium and gave it some updated specs. And while its new name is a shame, its pedigree remains unsullied (at least for now), which allows Dell's flagship 14-inch laptop to retain its title as one of the best Windows notebooks around. It features a slick, futuristic design with a hidden touchpad and love-or-hate-it multimedia controls along with solid performance, good enough battery life and welcome optional upgrades like a 3.2K OLED display and a discrete RTX 4050 GPU. So if you're looking for a portable and well-rounded Windows PC, it's hard to go wrong with the Dell 14 Premium. — Sam Rutherford, Senior Reporter

Pros

Sleek design

Vivid optional OLED display

Solid performance

Giant touchpad

Cons

Divisive capacitive touch buttons

Optional discrete GPU is one generation old

Best gaming laptop overall

ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14

Display: 2,880 x 1,800 | Screen size: 14 inches | Screen refresh rate: 120Hz | CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS | Processor speed: 4.00 GHz | GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 | Installed memory: Up to 32GB | Storage: Up to 1TB | Weight: 3.31 pounds | Battery life: Up to 10 hours | Dimensions: 12.24 x 8.66 x 0.63 inches | Available ports: 3.5mm headphone jack, 1x HDMI 2.0b, 1x USB 3.1 Gen 2, 2x USB 3.2 Gen 1, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2, DisplayPort

Read our ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 review

The beauty of the ASUS ROG Zephryus G14 is that it features an all-new unibody aluminum chassis, a vibrant 120Hz OLED display, solid performance and tons of ports–all for hundreds less than an equivalent Razer Blade 14. It even has a built-in microSD card reader and presets for several color gamuts, so it can easily pull double duty as a photo/video editing machine. Its audio is also way above average thanks to punchy up-firing stereo speakers. Battery life is solid too, with the Zephyrus lasting just shy of eight hours on our rundown test. And to top it off, the G14 weighs almost half a pound less than rival laptops with similar designs.

The main downsides are that its GPU caps out at an RTX 4070 (instead of a 4080 like on the previous model) and that its RAM is soldered in. But if you want a really great all-rounder that offers big power in a portable package, this system has to be at the top of your list.

If you're set on having a larger screen, the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G16 is available now as well. And if you've got a tight budget, there are still options for you. Our top pick for the best budget gaming laptop is currently the Dell G15. — Sam Rutherford, Senior Writer, Reviews

Pros

Beautiful understated design

Gorgeous OLED screen

Strong performance

Good port selection

Punchy speakers

Cons

Bottom vents can get a bit toasty

Keyboard only has single-zone lighting

Armoury Crate app is kind of messy

RAM is soldered in

Best Chromebook

Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5

Display: FHD | Screen size: 14 inches | Screen refresh rate: 60Hz | CPU: 13th-generation Intel Core i3 | Processor speed: 2.1 GHz | Installed memory: Up to 8GB | Storage: 128GB | Weight: 3.52 lb (1.6 kg) | Battery life: Up to 10 hours | Dimensions: 12.2 x 8.43 x 0.83 inches | Available ports: 3x USB 3.2 Gen 1, 3.5mm headphone jack, HDMI

Our favorite Chromebook is Lenovos Flex 5 Chromebook, which Engadgets resident Chrome OS aficionado Nathan Ingraham described as a tremendous value. This laptop nails the basics, with a 14-inch Full HD touchscreen, a great backlit keyboard and a 13th-gen Core i3 processor. The latest model has an upgraded 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, which when paired with the Core i3 CPU, make for a speedy, capable machine. Its also nice to see one USB-A and two USB-C ports, six hours of battery life and a 360-degree hinge that makes it easy to use the Flex 5 as a tablet. This could be the ideal laptop for Chrome OS fans, and itll hit the sweet spot for a lot of other buyers out there, providing a level of quality and performance thats pretty rare to find at this price point.

Pros

Great overall performance for the price

Nice display

Solid keyboard and trackpad

Cons

Mediocre battery life

A bit heavy and chunky

Display: Micro-edge | Screen size: 13.3 inches | Screen refresh rate: 60Hz | CPU: AMD Ryzen 5000 series | Processor speed: 3.3 GHz | GPU: AMD Radeon | Installed memory: 16 GB | Storage: 256GB | Weight: 2.2 lb (<1 kg) | Battery life: Up to 10.5 hours | Dimensions: 11.72 x 8.23 x 0.67 inches | Available ports: USB 3.2 Gen 2, 2x USB 3.2 Gen 1, HDMI 2.1, 3.5mm headphone jack

Read our HP Pavilion Aero review

If youre looking for a budget laptop priced around $800, your best bet is the HP Pavilion Aero 13. For around $799 (or often less when on sale), youll get a Full HD screen with a 16:10 aspect ratio and surprisingly thin bezels, as well as a comfortable keyboard and spacious touchpad. Importantly, the Aero 13 provides solid performance and relatively powerful components compared to others in this price range, with an AMD Ryzen 5000 series processor and Radeon graphics. Plus, this pick for best budget laptop has a generous array of ports and all-day battery life.

Pros

Best high-end laptop

Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch

Display: Liquid Retina XDR | Screen size: 14 inches | Screen refresh rate: 120Hz | CPU: Apple M5 | Installed memory: Up to 128GB | Storage: Up to 8TB | Weight: Starts at 3.4 pounds | Battery life: Up to 24 hours | Dimensions: 12.31 x 8.71 x 0.61 inches (14 inch) | Available ports: HDMI, 3.5mm headphone jack, MagSafe 3, 3x Thunderbolt 4, SDXC card slot

Read our full 14-inch Apple MacBook Pro M5 review

The M5 update of the 14-inch MacBook Pro makes an already great laptop even better. The M5 chip offers a slightly faster CPU, but the big upgrade is its revamped GPU, which performed noticeably better in games and benchmarks compared to the M4 MacBook Pro.

Otherwise, it's more of the same – but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The MacBook Pro is still one of the most well-designed notebooks around, with a luxurious all-metal case and sturdy build quality. Its 14.2-inch screen is plenty bright, and it also offers ProMotion support for smoother 120Hz refresh rates. The only major downside this year is that there's still no OLED option (that's rumored to arrive in 2026).

The 14-inch MacBook Pro is the ideal professional-grade laptop for most creators, and it may even tempt over some gamers with its more powerful graphics. Thankfully, Apple hasn't touched its excellent keyboard and touchpad, and it still offers a healthy selection of port options.

Pros

Faster GPU than M4

Excellent design

Wonderful keyboard and trackpad

Useful port selection

Long battery life

Cons

No OLED screen option

Upgrades can get pricy

Best 2-in-1 laptop

HP Spectre x360 14

Display: OLED touchscreen | Screen size: 14 inches | Screen refresh rate: 120Hz | CPU: Intel Core Ultra 5 125H | Processor speed: 4.5 GHz | Installed memory: Up to 32GB | Storage: Up to 2TB | Weight: 3.19 pounds | Battery life: Up to 13 hours | Dimensions: 12.35 x 8.68 x 0.67 inches | Available ports: USB-A, 2x Thunderbolt 4

Read our HP Spectre x360 14 review

If you want a laptop that can occasionally turn into a tablet, HPs new Spectre x360 14 is our top choice for the best 2-in-1 laptop. Its a beautiful notebook that can rotate its screen into a variety of orientations: a tent mode for propping it up in bed or on a table and a tablet mode with the keyboard tucked away neatly behind the lid. While it wouldnt completely replace something like an iPad, the x360s rotating hinge makes it more versatile than a conventional notebook. Its perfect for diving into a lengthy article or PDF or using the bundled stylus to jot down some notes. The Spectre x360 14 is also a solid laptop in its own right, with an excellent keyboard, an extra-large touchpad and some of the best PC industrial design on the market.

Pros

Versatile convertible screen

OLED display is incredibly vibrant

Solid CPU upgrade

Starts with 16GB RAM

Excellent keyboard

Plenty of ports

Cons

HPs design hasnt changed in years

Haptic touchpad is a bit finicky

After more than a decade of tests and trials for Arm-based Windows PCs, Microsofts Surface Laptop 7 feels like a breakthrough. Its fast, its quiet and thanks to Qualcomms Snapdragon X Elite chip, it delivers well above average performance and battery life. Meanwhile, on the inside, Microsofts Prism emulator has almost completely smashed the barrier between Arm and x86, so aside from gaming, almost all of your favorite apps just work. Tack on a bright 120Hz display and excellent build quality and you get something really close to an ideal ultraportable PC. — Sam Rutherford, Senior Reporter

Pros

Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12

Display: 1,920 x 1,200 WUXGA | Screen size: 14-inch | Screen refresh rate: 60Hz | CPU: Intel Core Ultra 7 | Processor speed: 4.8 GHz | Installed memory: Up to 32GB | Storage: Up to 1TB | Weight: 2.4 pounds | Battery life: 13 hours (tested) | Dimensions: 0.59 x 12.31 x 8.45 inches | Available ports: 2x USB-A, 2x Thunderbolt 4, 3.5mm headphone jack, HDMI

Read our full Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12 review

The latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon deserves a shout on this list because its been one of the best options for business users for a long time and continues to be. The Get 12 model runs on the newest Intel Core Ultra CPUs and includes an integrated NPU, a 14-inch matte touchscreen, a larger trackpad and a spill-proof keyboard. It performed well in our real-world testing, handling everything from dozens of Chrome tabs to light video editing without breaking a sweat. It didnt score as well on some of our benchmark tests as other top picks like the HP Spectre x360, but that wont be a dealbreaker for most people. Workers who spend hours typing away at emails and spreadsheets will appreciate the spacious 4.7-inch glass trackpad and Lenovos signature, comfortable keyboard thats also nicely backlit. On top of that, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12 lasted up to 13 hours in our battery tests, which should be more than enough to carry you through even your longest days. — Valentina Palladino, Deputy Editor, Buying Advice

How we test laptops

Engadget has been reviewing laptops for two decades, and while the definition of what a portable PC is has changed considerably since, our obsession with testing their limits and serving up informative buying advice remains the same. Be it a hybrid tablet like Microsoft's Surface machines, a rotating 2-in-1 convertible like HP's Spectre x360s or a plain old clamshell notebook, our review process follows similar beats. How does it look and feel? How fast is it? Whether its a Windows device powered by an Intel Core i5 or higher, a MacBook or a Chromebook, we aim to answer the most important question: Is it actually worth your hard-earned cash? We also pay close attention to portability, webcam quality and display features, including IPS panels and nits of brightness, as they can make a big difference in daily use.

Factors to consider when choosing a laptop

Operating system: Apple, Windows or Chrome OS

There's a good chance you've already committed to an operating system, but my advice is to be as flexible as possible. These days, most major software is compatible with both Macs and PCs. (Of course, it's another story if you've become dependent on an Apple-only app like Final Cut Pro.) Web-based apps, naturally, will work on any platform with an internet browser.

If you're an Apple-loyalist, there aren't many reasons to consider Windows laptops (unless you want a secondary gaming machine). But for Windows users, macOS is becoming more tempting every year. Apple's MacBooks, powered by its M-series Silicon chips, are among the fastest and most efficient laptops we've ever seen. They're incredibly well-built and have outstanding battery life to boot. MacOS itself is also an easy platform to learn, especially if you're used to iOS and iPadOS.

That brings up another point: iPhone users may want to consider Macs because of the seamless integration with Apple's other platforms. You can't respond to iMessage conversations easily or hop into FaceTime chats on Windows PCs, but doing so is simple on Macs. (Microsoft's Phone Link app lets you send iOS users individual texts, but not media or group chats.) Android users, meanwhile, may be better off with Windows, as Phone Link can make calls, synchronize all your texts and also access your phone's photos.

If cloud gaming is your priority, Windows laptops with NVIDIAs GeForce Now or Xbox Cloud Gaming compatibility may offer more flexibility and decent performance, especially when paired with fast internet speeds. Chromebooks also make a compelling case here as an affordable, lightweight solution for casual cloud gaming sessions.

As for whether youll want a PC with a dedicated Copilot AI button on the keyboard, that depends on how often you see yourself using Microsofts generative tools. Given were only just seeing the first slate of AI PCs, it would be wiser to wait out the hype and see what improvements might come over time.

And what about ChromeOS? Chromebooks are a smart and (typically) inexpensive way to do things like web browsing and hopping on a few video chats, but for most, they're not the best choice as a primary computer. There aren't many apps or games that work offline, and they also don't work with powerful software suites like Adobe's (you can use the stripped-down Adobe Express and Photoshop online tools, though).

Chromebooks are great secondary machines to use alongside a more powerful Mac or PC, and they're popular in schools because they're cheap and easy for IT workers to manage. And if all you need is web browsing access, or a notebook for a kid, a Chromebook might be enough.

If, for some reason, youre looking for a powerful ChromeOS system, there are also Chromebook Plus models to consider. These machines sport faster processors and more RAM than typical Google notebooks, and they can also tap into a few of the companys online AI features, like AI image generation and photo processing.

Price

You can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a new laptop these days, depending on the configuration. If you're looking for more of a workhorse, that could cost you well over $2,000 for additional RAM, storage, as well as a beefier graphics card and CPU. But you can also find some good laptops under $1,000 if you're willing to overlook build quality (or buy a refurbished or previous generation machine, which we highly recommend). Systems with AMD chips tend to come in cheaper than their Intel counterparts, but the bulk of their cost will come down to other components like RAM and storage.

Ive included our favorite affordable model in this best laptop buying guide, but we have a list of the best budget laptops that you can check out as well.

Laptop size and weight

So how portable do you want your laptop to be? That's the ultimate question you need to ask when choosing between various screen sizes. 13-inch machines have become a solid starting point for most shoppers — it's enough real estate for the majority of tasks like emailing and writing, and it also helps keep machines relatively light (typically between two to three pounds). Thanks to manufacturing advancements, these dainty machines sometimes even come with larger screens (the smaller MacBook Air actually has a 13.6-inch display).

If you have trouble seeing fine text, wed recommend going for a display larger than 13 inches. ASUSs Zephyrus G14 is a solid 14-inch option for gamers, and were also seeing more productivity-focused machines aim for that size, like the Dell 14 Premium and MacBook Pro. While 14-inch notebooks are a bit heavier than 13-inch models, coming in between three to four pounds, their screens are noticeably roomier.

For artists, or anyone else who needs a large canvas, a 15-inch laptop may make the most sense. They typically weigh between 3.5 and 4.5 pounds, but that extra heft may be worth it to fit wider video editing timelines or Photoshop windows. And, as you'd expect, you'll also pay a bit more for a 15-inch notebook compared to smaller ones (the 15-inch MacBook Air starts at $1,199, while the smaller model goes for $999). PC makers are also replacing 15-inch systems with 16-inch versions, which will give you even more space to work.

If you're in the market for a business laptop, size and portability might be key considerations. A lightweight yet powerful system with a long battery life can make a world of difference if you travel frequently for work.

You can still find laptops with 17-inch or 18-inch screens, but those are typically gaming systems or souped-up workstations. They're not meant for mere computing mortals.

Ports and connectivity

These days, most laptops ship with a few USB-C ports, which can handle both charging and speedy data transfers. Apple's MacBooks also include a separate connection for MagSafe power, and you'll find custom power connections on some PCs like Microsoft's Surface. Older USB Type-A connections are less common now, but they still pop up in systems like HP's Spectre x360 14, as well as many models from ASUS.

For gamers or creators who rely on discrete graphics, ensuring your laptop has the right ports for external monitors or GPUs is crucial. DisplayPort or HDMI connections can also ensure youre ready for dual- or multi-screen setups for more immersive experiences. Similarly, if you want to save high-resolution files or install multiple games, you might need to consider additional hard drive space; external hard drives are pretty affordable, as long as you have a proper port to connect them.

If you're a fan of wired headphones, it's worth keeping a close eye on headphone jack availability. They usually include a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter, but that's a clunky solution, and it also takes up a USB port. Sure, most people use wireless earbuds and cans today, but it's still helpful to have a wired one around for when those devices run out of juice.

Most laptops today offer Wi-Fi 6 or 6E and Bluetooth 5.0 or later, which should mean faster and more stable connections if you have compatible routers and devices. While Wi-Fi 7 routers have started appearing, that spec hasn't made its way into laptops yet. As for cellular coverage, there are notebooks like the Surface Pro 9 and Samsung Galaxy Book models that offer integrated 5G. But from our testing, that feature may not be worth the cost of a separate data plan. Instead, you could tether to your smartphone or invest in a wireless hotspot that can keep multiple devices online.

Battery life

A laptop's battery life depends on several factors: The power draw from the screen and other hardware, the optimizations used to avoid unnecessary power drain, and, of course, the size of the actual battery. One of our previous favorite systems, the Dell XPS 13, lasted 13 hours and 15 minutes in the PCMark 10 battery benchmark. In real-world testing, I was able to use it for a day and a half without needing a recharge. The MacBook Air 13-inch, meanwhile, more than 18 hours in our benchmark and kept running for more than two work days of my typical workflow. In general, you should expect a modern laptop to last at least eight hours.

If battery life is your absolute priority, I'd strongly suggest looking at Macs over Windows PCs. Apple's M-series chips are essentially mobile hardware, with all of the power efficiency you'd expect from something originally designed for phones. Qualcomms upcoming Snapdragon chips could help Windows PCs compete with Apples astonishing battery life, but weve yet to see those in action. Chromebooks also typically get decent battery life (as long as you dont overstuff them with power-draining tabs).

Refresh rate

A laptop's refresh rate refers to the amount of times its screen is cycled every second. Modern displays like IPS LCDs and OLEDs support 60Hz refresh rates at a minimum, but we're seeing more devices offering 120Hz, 240Hz and beyond. The higher the number, the faster the screen is refreshed, which ultimately leads to a smoother experience while mousing around or scrolling through web pages. (If you want to get a sense of what a slow refresh rate looks like, just grab an e-reader like the Kindle and try to flip between book pages.)

While high refresh rates used to be reserved for gaming laptops, nowadays we're seeing more mainstream machines like the Dell 14 Premium offer 120Hz (or variable rates that move between 60Hz and 120Hz).

CPU and GPU

If youre buying a new laptop, youll want to make sure its powered by the latest CPUs. For Windows PCs, that includes Intels Core Ultra chips for thin-and-light machines or the 14th-gen HX chips for beefier systems. The Core Ultra series have NPUs for handling AI tasks, while the HX hardware does not – theyre based on Intels previous chip architecture, and theyre more focused on delivering raw horsepower. Intel's older 13th-gen and 12th-gen laptop chips also don't have NPUs, so keep that in mind if you're looking at used systems.

You'll also see AMD's Ryzen 8000 and 9000 chips in plenty of new systems like the ASUS Zephyrus G14 and Razer Blade 14. Those CPUs mainly target gaming laptops and high performance systems, while you'll still find AMDs older Ryzen 7000 chips in ultraportables. AMD's main advantage is that its chips also include Radeon graphics, which are far more capable than Intel's Arc hardware (though those are getting better).

Qualcomms new Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus are also an option in Copilot+ PCs (more on those below). Since theyre based on mobile chip designs, theyre likely also more power efficient than AMD and Intels hardware. In the past, weve avoided recommending Snapdragon chips because they led to a slow and frustrating Windows experience. But Microsoft claims its rebuilt Windows 11 around Snapdragons Arm-based architecture, which should lead to far faster performance and better app compatibility.

As for Apple's laptops, you'll be choosing between the M4 Pro, M4 Max and M5, each of which is progressively more powerful.

On the graphics side of things, a GPU, or graphics processing unit, is the component that communicates directly with a laptop's display. Laptop CPUs all have some form of integrated GPU: Intel has either its standard graphics or beefier Arc hardware, while AMD's chips include fast Radeon mobile graphics. If you want to play demanding games at high speeds (measured in frames per second, or fps), or if you need some extra power for rendering video or 3D models, you can configure a laptop with a dedicated GPU like NVIDIA's RTX 40-series hardware or AMD's Radeon RX 7000. Just be sure to leave room in your budget if you want a powerful GPU, as they typically add $300 or more to the cost of a laptop.

Apple's M-series chips, meanwhile, have GPU cores that can perform as well as NVIDIAs and AMD's lower-end dedicated GPUs. That's quite the accomplishment for systems like this (especially the MacBook Air and 14-inch MacBook Pro), and it's another reason we highly recommend Apple's notebooks.

AI PCs, NPUs and Copilot+

Simply put, an AI PC is a computer equipped with a neural processing unit (NPU), which is designed to handle AI-related tasks. Much like how GPUs tackle heavy-duty gaming and rendering workloads, NPUs are designed to handle the complex math necessary for AI workloads. Theyre also far more power efficient than CPUs or GPUs, which could lead to better battery performance in laptops. While many factors go into NPU performance, for the most part we measure their potential speed by TOPS (tera operations per second).

We were primed for AI PCs based on the chips Intel and AMD announced in 2023. Intel unveiled its "Core Ultra" CPUs in December, its first to include an NPU for AI work. AMD also announced its Ryzen 8040 AI mobile chips that month (and it couldn't help but say they were faster than Intel's new hardware). But in May, Microsoft announced its Copilot+ initiative, which is pushing major PC makers to deliver premium AI PCs with specifications including 16GB of RAM, 256GB SSDs and NPUs with at least 40 TOPS of AI performance.

Copilot+ is more than just a marketing term: Microsoft is also launching AI-powered features in Windows 11 that take advantage of powerful NPUs. That includes Recall, which can help you locate anything youve done on your PC (whenever it finally launches), as well as Cocreator in Paint, which can generate AI images based on text prompts and doodles.

If you buy an AI PC that isnt Copilot+ certified, youll still be able to use some features like Windows Studio Effects, which can blur your background in video calls or keep you in frame. Developers like Adobe and Audacity are also building features into their apps that can take advantage of NPUs.

At the time of this post, Chromebook Plus notebooks can also access a few of Googles online AI features, like image generation and photo processing.

Other laptops we tested

Lenovo ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition

The ThinkPad X9-14 Aura Edition is a great spiritual successor to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, offering the best that business laptops have to offer. That includes long battery life packed into a thin and light chassis. This is an optimal ultraportable business laptop.

While the price might give you some pause, we tested the lowest configuration, and found that the X9-14s performance is excellent for casual business users. The only issue with quality is that the keyboard is lacking. Its mushier than wed like, which could get a bit tiresome throughout the day. Youll still miss out on a USB Type-A port, so you may need to carry a Type-C hub with you.

Where the ThinkPad X9-14 will win you over is its bold OLED screen. Combo that with its well-rounded audio, and the ThinkPad X9-14 makes for an excellent multimedia device in and out of the workplace.

ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED

Aside from its lovely OLED screen, the ASUS Zenbook 14 OLED doesn't stand out from the crowded laptop field in any way. It just looks dull and boring, especially compared to the strikingly beautiful ASUS Zephyrus G14, which also came out this year. While you can probably find the Zenbook 14 for a decent price, I'd recommend holding out for something with a bit more personality (and with a less wobbly screen hinge).

Razer Blade 14

The Razer Blade has almost everything you'd want in a 14-inch gaming notebook, but it's far pricier than the Zephyrus G14 on this list, and it doesnt even have an SD card reader. It would be a solid competitor once its price falls a bit, and it's certainly a great option if you just have to have a jet-black laptop.

Framework Laptop 16

Framework gave its modularity magic to the Laptop 16, delivering a gaming notebook where almost every single component is user replaceable. But you'll have to pay a pretty penny to snag it with upgraded hardware, and its optional Radeon 7700S GPU was surprisingly slow.

Alienware m16 R2

The Alienware m16 r2 has been revamped with a slimmer case, but its otherwise a fairly typical gaming laptop. Its a solid option for Alienware fans, but youll find better hardware and deals elsewhere.

ASUS Zenbook Duo (2024)

The Zenbook Duo is a fascinating dual-screened notebook, and according to my colleague Sam Rutherford its the first of its kind thats worth buying. But its unique hardware isnt really meant for mainstream consumers, and Windows 11 still doesnt support multi-screen setups well enough to make full use of the Zenbook Duos ample canvas.

Dell XPS 16

Dells XPS 16 is big and beautiful, but its far too expensive compared to the competition. Plus, it uses a capacitive row of function keys that you basically cant see under bright light and has too few ports for a machine of this size.

Laptop FAQs

What is the average battery life of a laptop per charge?

Its hard to come up with an average battery life for laptops, since that will ultimately depend on what youre doing with them. An ultraportable like the MacBook Air that sips power can last around 20 hours in our battery benchmark, and around two full work days of real-world usage. But a gaming laptop may last only a few hours if youre actively playing something while on battery. At this point, Macs are delivering far better battery life than PCs, thanks to Apples Silicon chips, but Microsoft claims Copilot+ systems with Qualcomm chips will also get over 20 hours of batter life.

How much RAM do I really need?

The more RAM you have, the more things your computer can do simultaneously. For that reason, we recommend buying PCs and Macs with at least 16GB of RAM. That gives you enough memory to have several applications open at once, as well as web browsers filled with RAM-hogging tabs. Many PC games also require at least 16GB of RAM. While you could use a system with 8GB of RAM for basic tasks, youll quickly run into slowdowns and error messages as your apps stack up. Many laptops, especially ultraportables, dont let you upgrade RAM, too – so youll have to buy an entirely new computer if you didnt equip enough memory at the start.

If youre a hardcore gamer, programmer or planning to render videos or 3D models, then you may want to go for 32GB of RAM or more. And if you just need a secondary laptop for lighter work – perhaps a no-frills system for writing – then you can probably get by with 8GB. Just be sure to keep those browser tabs in check.

What is the best storage capacity for a laptop?

There is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to laptop storage. Youll typically find configurations between 256GB and 1TB SSDs (solid state drives) on most laptops, and Id recommend most people get at least 512GB. Thatll be enough space for large apps, music and video files without stressing your system too much. If youre a media hoarder, or want to play a ton of games, then its definitely worth getting a 1TB SSD.

If youll mainly be streaming your shows and music, and would rather invest in RAM or other hardware, then 256GB of storage would be serviceable. Id recommend staying away from any machine with 128GB of storage though. Most of that will be taken up by the operating system, and youll likely run into issues cramming in large apps after a few months.

We recommend springing for extra built-in storage or investing in a portable SSD for backing up your most important files. It's also worth noting that Chromebooks tend to come with less built-in storage — 32GB, 64GB or 128GB — since ChromeOS encourages users to save their files in the cloud rather than on the device. In that case, 128GB is plenty.

What's a good price range for a decent laptop in 2025?

You can expect to spend between $1,000 and $1,800 for a typical 13-inch laptop today. As I explained above, you'll pay more if you want to stuff in more RAM or better GPU hardware. But you can also find deals below $1,000 if you look for refurbished or older-generation models.

Whats the difference between macOS and Windows? Which is better?

Simply put, macOS is the operating system in all of Apple's notebooks and desktops, while Windows powers the vast majority of PCs. You'll also find Chromebooks running Google's ChromeOS, but those are basically just web browsers running on top of Linux.

Debating the differences between Windows and Macs is something PC nerds have been doing since the '80s, so we won't be declaring a winner here. There are some small, negligible distinctions, like using a Command versus a Control key, how file explorers work and concerns about viruses and security. For the most part, those are minor issues or have become moot thanks to better built-in security.

But if you care more about playing the newest games, you'll want to have a Windows system. If you're more focused on creative apps, like Photoshop, Premiere and Final Cut Pro, then macOS may be a better fit (especially if you're running an iPhone).

What are the best laptop brands?

There is no single "best" laptop brand, but judging from this guide alone, we're generally impressed by notebooks from Apple, Dell and ASUS. They all offer fast, reliable and sturdy machines. HP also makes some eye-catching devices if you want an option thats the most aesthetic. Those four brands, along with Lenovo and Acer, dominate laptop sales worldwide. We'd avoid systems from any retail store brands, or companies that don't have a major presence in the US.
