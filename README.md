A high school student in Baltimore County, Maryland was reportedly handcuffed and searched after an AI security system flagged his bag of chips as a possible firearm.

Taki Allen, a student at Kenwood High School, told CNN affiliate WBAL, “I was just holding a Doritos bag — it was two hands and one finger out, and they said it looked like a gun.” But as a result, Allen said, “They made me get on my knees, put my hands behind my back, and cuffed me.”
