Lyft is partnering with San Jose-based Tensor Auto. Lyft says it has reserved "hundreds" of Tensor robotaxis and will operate its own fleet. The other piece of the partnership: Tensor will make its Robocar "Lyft-ready" straight out of the factory.

Shipping the Robocar with Lyft's platform will allow a futuristic form of passive income for owners in regions with level 4 regulatory approval. "Traditional car ownership means a vehicle loses value as it sits idle most of the time," the companies wrote in a press release. "Tensor Robocars flip this model, turning personal luxury vehicles into productive assets that can generate income around the clock."

It's similar to what Tesla plans to do with its yet-to-be-shipped Cybercab. Lyft's rival Uber announced a similar plan in July, involving 20,000 Lucid EVs.

That's also a rendering.

Tensor plans to deliver its first Robocars by the end of 2026. The company says the "Lyft-ready" autonomous vehicle (AV) will include over 100 sensors. (That includes 37 cameras, five lidars, and 11 radars.) Eight NVIDIA chips, based on Blackwell GPU architecture, help it interpret sensor data. Tensor says the computer is capable of 8,000 trillion operations per second.

This is far from Lyft's first AV partnership. Among others, it teamed up last month with May Mobility to launch an autonomous fleet in Atlanta. Lyft also plans to match users with Waymo rides in Nashville starting next year. However, Bloomberg notes that the Tensor partnership is Lyft's first where it will purchase and operate its own AV fleet.

Tensor spun out of the Chinese robotaxi company AutoX. The company says it divested and discontinued its China operations to focus exclusively on the US-based Tensor. The Robocar will be produced in Vietnam through a partnership with VinFast.
