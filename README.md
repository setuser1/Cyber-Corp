Bed bugs: the nightmare of any city dweller, frequent traveler, and now Google employee. The team at the company's Chelsea campus were notified on Sunday that a possible bed bug infestation had been discovered in the building and were told to remain at home so the location could be treated. As if working over the weekend wasn't enough of a bummer. Fortunately, exterminators collected their bug bounty, and employees were allowed to return to the building on Monday morning.

Google told employees to file a report if they had symptoms of bed bug bites or saw evidence of bed bugs on site, according to an email sent by the company and obtained by Wired. They were also told to contact professional exterminators if they accidentally brought bed bugs home; hopefully Google foots the bill for those unlucky people.

According to Wired's sources, the infestation may have been caused by "a number of large stuffed animals" in the Google office, but the publication wasn't able to confirm that. It's always the ones you least suspect.
