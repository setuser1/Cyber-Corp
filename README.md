Lee Roberts meets me at the University Club of San Francisco on a Friday morning, hours before his football team will lose to Cal in heartbreaking fashion – a fumble at the goal line, because little about the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hills expensive experiment with Bill Belichick has gone according to script.

But Roberts, the Chancellor of UNC, doesnt know this yet. Right now, hes in California to talk about artificial intelligence, which is both forward thinking and also – Id hazard a guess – a welcome distraction from a lot else happening at the 235-year-old school.
