Apple had big plans for the the future of the Vision Pro, but it has reportedly put them on the back burner and has prioritized the development of smart glasses that can compete directly against the Meta Ray-Bans. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the company told staff last week that it's moving team members working on a cheaper and lighter version of the Vision Pro to accelerate the development of its smart glasses. Apple is apparently developing two models, one of which, called the "N50," has no display of its own and will pair with iPhones. The company reportedly intends to launch it sometime next year and will it release in 2027.

Bloomberg says Apple is also working on smart glasses with an augmented reality display that can rival the Meta Ray-Ban Display. It was going to release the model in 2028, but now Apple is looking to expedite its development, presumably so it could be available at an earlier date. Like Meta's smart glasses, Apple's devices will rely heavily on voice interaction and AI commands. Bloomberg previously reported that Apple is releasing an updated Siri next year that's powered by large language models, meant for use on displays, speakers and, yes, glasses.

Apple's smart glasses will reportedly come in a variety of styles, will be powered by a new chip and will have speakers for playback, as well as cameras to capture images and videos. The company is looking to equip it with health-tracking capabilities, as well.

It has long been reported that Apple's ultimate goal was to release augmented reality glasses of its own, since they could rival phones in the future. If this report is true, Apple is merely adjusting its timeline, especially since it's now fairly behind Meta in the space. While Apple's priorities have shifted, it hasn't abandoned the Vision Pro altogether. The FCC recently uploaded documents referencing an updated "Head Mounted Device" by Apple, though it's unclear if it's the upcoming lighter version that's supposed to be cheaper than the $3,499 original model.
