Amazon devices are already on sale for fall Prime Day. Case in point: the second-gen Kindle Scribe. The E Ink tablet with 16GB of storage is $100 off, down from $400 to $300, which is a record-low price. If you want more storage, the 32GB and 64GB versions are also 25 and 24 percent off, respectively.

The Kindle Scribe is our pick for best e-reader E Ink tablet. It scored an 86 in our review, thanks to the smooth reading and writing experience it provides. We were also fans of its sleek and slender design. It has a 10.2-inch screen and offers front lights that auto-adjust to your needs. Our biggest gripe was the cost which, thanks to this deal, is less of an issue.

It's worth noting that Amazon announced a few new Kindle Scribe models recently, but none of them are available just yet. The Kindle Scribe 3 has a thinner and lighter design, plus faster page-turning and writing experiences. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is Amazon's first full-color E Ink tablet. If you want the latest and greatest, it's worth it to wait â€” but Amazon hasn't yet named specific release dates for either new model. During its latest hardware event, it only said the new Scribes were coming "later this year."
