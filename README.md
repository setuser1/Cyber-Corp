If youve been waiting for a discount before grabbing a new iPad, MacBook or Apple Watch, Amazons October Prime Day sale might be worth checking out. Prime Big Deal Days, as its formally called, doesnt officially begin until October 7, but were keeping an eye out for the best Apple deals that are going on in the lead-up to the event. So far, weve found a few decent prices on devices like the entry-level iPad, MacBook Air, Mac mini and Apple Pencil Pro, as well as a few modest but early discounts on the new crop of Apple Watches. We'll update this post as more offers pop up.

Best Prime Day Apple deals

Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4, 512GB) for $999 ($200 off): The MacBook Air tops our guide to the best laptops. The latest model isnt a major overhaul, but its still exceptionally thin, lightweight and well-designed, and the M4 chip is more than powerful enough for everyday use. This deal is just a few bucks below the best price weve seen for a configuration with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Other configs with more memory are $200 off as well.

Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4, 512GB) for $1,199 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is essentially the same as the 13-inch version, only it has a roomier display, a more spacious trackpad and better speakers. This is another discount weve seen plenty of times before, but its only slightly higher than the all-time low for a model with 512GB of storage.

Apple iPad (A16, 256GB) for $399 ($50 off): The entry-level iPad earned a score of 84 in our review: If you mainly want a tablet for streaming, browsing the web, emailing or lighter word processing, it should do the job. It doesnt lose out on the Mac-style productivity features introduced with iPadOS 26 either. Weve seen this discount on the 256GB model fairly often in recent months, and its about $25 above the devices all-time low, but its still $50 cheaper than buying directly from Apple.

Apple

Apple Pencil Pro

$99$129Save $30

The Pencil Pro is Apples premium stylus, offering pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, haptic feedback and unique gesture controls compared to the standard Pencil. Its a dependably tool for sketching and note-taking; just note that its not compatible with the base iPad and most older models. This is another discount weve seen regularly over the past year, but its $30 off the pens list price.

$99 at Amazon

Apple AirTags (4-pack) for $75 ($24 off): With its enormous finding network and ultra-wideband tech for accurately locating nearby items, Apples AirTag is the top pick for iPhone users in our guide to the best Bluetooth trackers. We saw a four-pack fall as low as $65 earlier in the year, but this is still a nice drop from Apples list price. If youre not in desperate need for these, though, note that we may see an updated model later this year.

Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): This latest iteration of Apples tiny PC has a smaller footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM by default, two front-facing USB-C ports and an extra Thunderbolt 4 port. It can also drive three external displays, though it lacks USB-A ports entirely. We gave a higher-end config with Apples M4 Pro chip a score of 90 in our review. This deal is for the entry-level model with the base M4 chip and a 256GB SSD — its $30 above the all-time low but still a nice savings.

Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $240 ($9 off): Apple only released its latest crop of Apple Watches a couple weeks ago, but Amazon is selling each with a modest discount. The Watch SE 3, for instance, is available for $240: Thats just $9 off its list price, but its something if youre buying soon after launch anyway. As for the device itself, this third-gen version of the SE adds an always-on display, which makes it so you no longer have to wake the watch to check the time or your notifications. It now runs on the same S10 chip as its higher-end siblings, too, and it still covers the essential health and fitness features. If youre in the market for your first smartwatch, or if you only want a watch for step counting, sleep tracking and notifications, it should be a strong value.

Apple

Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS)

$390$399Save $9

The Series 11 is the top overall pick in our guide to the best smartwatches. Its not as compelling as the SE 3 from a value perspective, but it has a bigger, brighter and more scratch-resistant display, slightly longer battery life and support for more advanced health features like hypertension alerts and an ECG app. We gave it a score of 90 in our review. Just note that theres no pressing need to upgrade if youre happy with your current Apple Watch. This is a slight $9 discount, but we note it since the Series 11 hasnt been on sale for less than a month, so any bit of savings are welcome.

$390 at Amazon

Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm) for $780 ($19 off): The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is a much more niche device than the Series 11 or SE 3, aimed at serious athletes and adventurers more than the typical gymgoer. It is the biggest and most rugged Apple Watch, with the brightest display (up to 3,000 nits), longest battery life (up to 42 hours) and most advanced components. It also supports satellite communications. The watch normally retails for $799, so this isnt a major discount, but since this is a brand-new device, any drop at all is worth noting for early adopters.

Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS + Cellular) for $329 ($170 off): As a general rule, most people should buy the newest version of whatever Apple product they want. That said, the Series 11 is only a minor upgrade over the prior Series 10 — the glass is more scratch-resistant, the cellular model has 5G support, the battery is marginally bigger and thats about it. If youre mostly worried about saving cash, want LTE support and still need the more advanced health features the Apple Watch SE lacks, this is a worthwhile discount for a version of last years model with cellular support.

Apple Watch SE (2nd gen, 40mm, GPS + Cellular) for $189 ($110 off): The Apple Watch SE 3 is a far more substantial upgrade over its predecessor than the Series 11, so we strongly recommend paying the premium to get the latest version. But if youre sure you can live without the always-on display, faster charging, superior chip and other upgrades that come with the SE 3, the last-gen model can still get you most of the basic Apple Watch experience for less cash while it remains in stock. This is one of the lowest prices weve seen for the 40mm cellular model.
