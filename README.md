Zoom founder and CEO Eric Yuan believes that AI assistants will finally allow us to shorten our workweek. Speaking on stage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Monday, Yuan discussed his videoconferencing products embrace of AI, which includes a &#8220;digital twin&#8221; feature where an AI avatar can speak for you.
