Spotify just introduced a feature that lets users follow their favorite concert venues. This will provide people with updates and details about upcoming concerts.

Once a venue is selected as a favorite, it gets saved in a user's library. Browsing each venue provides information on scheduled concerts, general announcements and other stuff. Folks can even filter upcoming shows by genre. Clicking on a specific spot will also pull up "tailored suggestions for other venues" in the vicinity.

Spotify's new venue-tracking platform will offer links to each location's "official ticketing partner" to make it easier to scoop up some tickets. The company says it currently tracks over 20,000 venues throughout the globe, from "iconic arenas to beloved independent clubs."

Spotify also announced a change to its live event feed. This will now update daily instead of weekly. For the uninitiated, this tool tracks when artists are touring and lists nearby live events.

The platform recently added yet another tool for concert discovery in the form of custom playlists that highlight artists with upcoming shows in the area. These playlists update every week and include 30 songs.

These are welcome tools, as artists don't get paid a whole lot from streaming platforms, instead relying on live ticket sales. The features could also help stem some of the bad press that's been coming Spotify's way lately, thanks to CEO Daniel Ek's involvement with a weapons manufacturing company and the platform going running recruitment ads for controversial government entities like ICE.
