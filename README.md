Anthropic

At the end of February, Anthropic announced Claude Code. In the eight months since then, the coding agent has arguably become the company's most important product, helping it carve out a niche for itself in the highly competitive AI market. Now, Anthropic is making it easier for developers to use Claude Code in more places with a new web interface for accessing the agent.

To get started, you'll need connect Claude to your GitHub repositories. From there, the process of using the agent is the same as if it had direct terminal access. Describe what you need from it, and the agent will take it from there. Claude will provide progress updates while it works, and you can even steer it in real-time with additional prompts. Through the web interface, it's also possible to assign Claude multiple coding tasks to run in parallel.

"Every Claude Code task runs in an isolated sandbox environment with network and filesystem restrictions. Git interactions are handled through a secure proxy service that ensures Claude can only access authorized repositories â€” helping keep your code and credentials protected throughout the entire workflow," said Anthropic.

In addition to making Claude Code available on the web, Anthropic is releasing a preview of the agent inside of its iOS app. The company warns the integration is early, and that it hopes "to quickly refine the mobile experience based on your feedback."

Pro and Max users can start using Claude Code on the web today. Anthropic notes any cloud sessions share the same rate limits with all other Claude Code usage.
