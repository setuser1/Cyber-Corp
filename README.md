Tesla has been hit with an enforcement action by Californias Department of Insurance (CDI) for routinely denying or delaying customer claims despite years of warnings from the state regulator, according to a new pair of filings.

Teslas insurance arm, along with its partner State National Insurance Company, engaged in &#8220;willful unfair claims settlement practices&#8221; including &#8220;egregious delays in responding to policyholder claims in all steps&#8221; of the process and &#8220;unreasonable denials,&#8221; CDI wrote. This has allegedly caused &#8220;financial harm&#8221; and &#8220;distress to policyholders.&#8221;
