The movie industry has been in a tailspin for years, with many people foregoing the theatrical experience in favor of watching films at home. I get it. Going to the movies can be expensive and, lets face it, dealing with other people can be annoying (its been 10 years and Im still mad about those teenagers who would not stop giggling all the way through my first viewing of The Witch). But theres nothing quite like going to a theater and getting lost in a great film for a couple of hours. In addition, large-scale formats are growing in popularity and theater chains are trying to accommodate moviegoers.

Cinemark is installing more IMAX screens, including ones that support 70mm film projection. The company is adding such screens to its locations in Woodridge, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago); Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Rochester, New York. Its also adding four IMAX with Laser systems — a 4K laser offering — to other locations in the US in the coming months. Its upgrading its other 12 IMAX screens across the Americas with that tech too.

According to Variety, Cinemark plans to have the new IMAX 70mm film screens set up by July 17, 2026. Thats the release date for Christopher Nolans next film, The Odyssey, which is the first theatrical release to be shot entirely in IMAX. As it stands, only 30 movie theaters on the planet can screen films in IMAX 70mm, which is Nolans preferred format.

IMAX is proving popular with cinemagoers who are looking for a large-format experience that would be impossible at home (at least not without an obscene private screen). Indeed, many IMAX 70mm screenings of The Odyssey sold out a year in advance.

IMAX 70mm isnt the only format with limited availability thats drawing audiences to theaters. Paul Thomas Andersons One Battle After Another is the first movie in 60 years to be projected in the VistaVision format, but only at a few locations. The film is currently being screened in IMAX 70mm in some cinemas too.
