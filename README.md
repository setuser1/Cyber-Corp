Samsung's 2025 The Frame Pro QLED Mini LED Smart TV is on sale for a record-low price. The 65-inch model that normally retails for $2,200 is on sale for $1,760, which is the lowest we've ever seen it.

The 1-inch-thick "art" TV uses Samsung's impressive 4K Neo QLED panel, which is a quantum dot LCD panel with a Mini LED backlight array. The Frame Pro can display lifelike art pieces when the TV isn't in use, while its sleek design means it also looks great when turned off.

The Frame Pro comes with Samsung's new Wireless One Connect Box, which is supposed to help with cable management by putting the TV's inputs in a separate box that then wirelessly transmits the feed from your external device to the TV. It does require its own power supply, though, so that's one more plug needed if you are connecting a console or a streaming device.

The TV also carries the NQ4 AI Gen3 Processor, which imbues the Frame Pro with AI-enhanced picture and sound. This model also comes with Samsung Vision AI, which works to upscale the image on screen, create personalized experiences and more.

This 2025 model was just made available to order earlier this year, and the current sale price is surprisingly lower than it was during last week's Prime Day event, proving sometimes good things come to those who wait.
