For one week this summer, Taylor and her roommate wore GoPro cameras strapped to their foreheads as they painted, sculpted, and did household chores. They were training an AI vision model, carefully syncing their footage so the system could get multiple angles on the same behavior. It was difficult work in many ways, but they were well paid for it — and it allowed Taylor to spend most of her day making art.

“We woke up, did our regular routine, and then strapped the cameras on our head and synced the times together,” she told me. “Then we would make our breakfast and clean the dishes. Then wed go our separate ways and work on art.”
