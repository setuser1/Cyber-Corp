Lucid Motors delivered a record 4,078 vehicles in the third quarter, likely buoyed by a combination of more Gravity SUVs hitting the road and a rush of customers taking advantage of the expiring federal EV tax credit.

The Saudi-owned luxury EV startup is still way off the projections it used to go public in 2021 &#8212; a transaction that netted it $4 billion.

The third-quarter delivery figures announced Monday mark the seventh consecutive quarter that Lucid Motors has seen sales increase.
