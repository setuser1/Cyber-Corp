Apple will owe money to UK users after losing an App Store antitrust lawsuit there on Thursday, according to Financial Times. The Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled that the iPhone maker abused its dominant market position to inflate developer fees.

The tribunal found that the company has "near absolute market power" for iOS app distribution and in-app payments. The decision declared that Apple has been "abusing its dominant position by charging excessive and unfair prices." FT reports that Apple will appeal the decision.

The class action claimants said damages of about £1.5bn would be split between 36 million consumers. A subsequent hearing to determine the process for "resolving any questions relating to the calculation" of damages could come as soon as next month.

Apple has an increasingly strained relationship with the tighter regulations across the Atlantic. Earlier this week, the company stepped up its attacks on the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), a law designed to protect consumers from Big Tech dominance. And on Wednesday, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) confirmed that Apple has "strategic market status" in the country's equivalent of the DMA. That gives the CMA authority to "ensure that mobile platforms are open to effective competition."

Apple provided the following statement in response to the ruling:

"We thank the tribunal for its consideration but strongly disagree with this ruling, which takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy. The App Store has benefited businesses and consumers across the U.K., creating a dynamic marketplace where developers compete and users can choose from millions of innovative apps. This ruling overlooks how the App Store helps developers succeed and gives consumers a safe, trusted place to discover apps and securely make payments. The App Store faces vigorous competition from many other platforms — often with far fewer privacy and security protections — giving developers and consumers many options in how they build, share, and download apps. We intend to appeal."

Update, October 23, 2025, 5:30PM ET: This story has been updated to include a statement from Apple on today's ruling.
