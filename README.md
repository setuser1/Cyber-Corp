Last month, Alphabet told the House Judiciary Committee that it would allow some creators who were banned from YouTube for spreading COVID-19 and election-related misinformation to come back to the platform. Now, the company is outlining how that process will work, though it's not clear exactly who will be provided that opportunity,

YouTube says that beginning today it will give "some previously terminated creators" the ability to "request" a fresh channel in an effort the company is characterizing as a bid for "second chances" on the platform. The update doesn't reference its COVID-19 or election misinformation policies, which had come under fire from House Republicans. Instead, YouTube says that the "pilot program" will be available to some "qualified creators." It doesn't explain how it will determine who qualifies. Last month, far-right personalities Nick Fuentes and Alex Jones — both of whom were banned from YouTube years before the pandemic — attempted to rejoin YouTube after the letter was made public and were promptly removed.

"Our goal is to roll this out to creators who are eligible to apply over the coming months, and we appreciate the patience as we ramp up, carefully review requests, and learn as we go," the company wrote. "Not every type of channel termination will be eligible." Among the factors YouTube will consider are "whether the creator committed particularly severe or persistent violations of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service, or whether the creators on- or off-platform activity harmed or may continue to harm the YouTube community." People banned for copyright infringement won't be able to apply.

All that is still remarkably vague compared to the language Alphabet used in its letter to the House Judiciary Committee last month. "YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect," it said.

Importantly, YouTube isn't giving previously banned creators access to their old channels and subscribers. Anyone who is let back on under the program will instead have the opportunity to create an entirely new channel, which means they'll have to rebuild their presence from scratch.
