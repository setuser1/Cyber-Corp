Samsung is set to officially reveal its long-anticipated Android extended reality (XR) headset, which has been codenamed Project Moohan. The company has scheduled a livestream event for October 21 at 10PM ET.

The event will be streamed live via the company's YouTube page and on the official Samsung Newsroom site. We don't know how long the stream will be, but Samsung promises that Project Moohan will open up the "true potential" of mixed-reality devices.

This isn't just a reveal for a mixed-reality headset. Moohan is the very first device that uses Google's new Android XR operating system, which has been specifically designed for XR, VR and AR devices like glasses and headsets. We'll finally get to see what all the fuss is about and what kind of new tools the OS brings to the table.

Samsung says that this technology "seamlessly blends everyday utility with immersive new experiences." Hopefully we'll get a look at both everyday utility and immersive new experiences during the livestream.

We don't have official specs about the headset itself, but there have been plenty of leaks and rumors that will be confirmed or refuted during the stream. Leaks have suggested it includes a high-end display, advanced tracking and Gemini integration. These same leaks indicate a potential price tag of $1,800 to $2,800, making it more of a rival to the Apple Vision Pro than Meta's new Ray-Ban Display glasses.
