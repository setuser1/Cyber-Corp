Travel search engine Kayak will now allow users to research trips ahead of booking using AI. The company this week launched an &#8220;AI Mode&#8221; feature that lets users ask travel-related questions as well as compare and book flights, hotels, and cars, through an AI chatbot integrated on the companys website.

The feature is currently available across both desktop and mobile web, and takes advantage of Kayaks integration with ChatGPT to deliver contextual results.
