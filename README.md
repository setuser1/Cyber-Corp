This week, OpenAI announced that apps can now run directly inside ChatGPT, letting users book travel, create playlists, and edit designs without switching between different apps. Some immediately declared it the app platform of the future &#8212; predicting a ChatGPT-powered world where Apples App Store becomes obsolete.

An open question was answered today &#8211; "what will the AI-native distribution channel be?"

It looks like ChatGPT will be that channel with 800M active users + the Apps SDK.

This is likely as important as Steve Jobs announcing the app store in March of 2008 &#8230; pic.twitter.com/6RCbIi0foq
