After the success of OpenAIs video editing app Sora, now at the top of the U.S. App Store, Google may be looking to give its Gemini AI app a more visually focused revamp. The company is seemingly experimenting with a new user interface that would shift the app from having a chatbot-style look and feel to one offering a scrollable feed with suggested prompts accompanied by eye-catching photos.

The changes were spotted in a recent version of the Gemini Android app by the news site Android Authority but are not yet live to the public. Instead, by looking into the apps code, a reverse engineer enabled the apps new home screen. Here, shortcut buttons to do things like &#8220;Create Image&#8221; or access &#8220;Deep Research&#8221; were moved up on the screen and were then followed by the scrollable feed.
