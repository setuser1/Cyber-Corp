Waymo is currently the robotaxi leader in the United States, and that status has put the companys vehicles in the crosshairs of vandals multiple times over the last year â€” most recently this past weekend in Los Angeles. On the sidelines of TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said vandalism against Waymos robotaxis is &#8220;not okay.&#8221;

&#8220;Obviously, vandalism is a crime, so were very focused on working with law enforcement to make sure that we pursue the people who are committing these crimes against our fleet,&#8221; Mawakana told TechCrunch. &#8220;It doesnt matter whose fleet it is. Its not acceptable, its not okay, and so, damaging property? Were not standing for it.&#8221;
