Fitness tech appears to be having a strange spat. Earlier this week, Strava filed a lawsuit alleging that Garmin infringed on its patents for two features related to tracking exercise routes: segments and heatmaps. It's also claiming that Garmin violated a Master Cooperation Agreement by developing its own heat map feature. The complaint (via The Verge) is seeking a permanent injunction to stop Garmin from selling any items with segments or a heat map features, which would amount to a majority of Garmin's hardware products as well as its Connect tracking program.

The lawsuit on its own is a surprise. Strava and Garmin are two major players in fitness tech that have worked together for about a decade, the pair have a number of integrations between their platforms. It also seems unlikely that Strava will make much headway with the case. DC Rainmaker, which first picked up on the lawsuit, has a thorough timeline of the companies' patent filings that strongly suggests the arguments won't hold water in court. It's also strange that these alleged infringements, by Strava's own assertions, began a long time ago and yet the company is only taking issue with them now.

But the situation got even stranger when Strava Chief Product Officer Matt Salazar took to Reddit today to give some insight into why the company is taking such aggressive action against a frequent partner. According to Salazar's post, Strava is invoking the lawyers because Garmin is adopting new developer guidelines for API partners "that required the Garmin logo to be present on every single activity post, screen, graph, image, sharing card etc." Although he frames it as a move to protect users' data, the argument sounds more like a petty complaint that Garmin is putting its brand on the data its products are used to collect.

It's a weird lawsuit, and hopefully one that won't cause any disruptions for either company's customers.
