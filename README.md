Anbernic

After remaking every Game Boy model imaginable, Anbernic is ready to take on the next frontier of classic gaming handhelds: the Nintendo DS. In its usual drip-feed fashion, the handheld maker released a teaser video revealing the Anbernic RG DS. The company didn't offer many details for its Nintendo DS clone, but announced that it would cost less than $100.

That price tag isn't surprising for anyone who's been following Anbernic's recipe of recreating iconic handhelds at an affordable price point. However, it's still an attractive price point that's even cheaper than the Nintendo DS' original MSRP of $149.99. Beyond price, Anbernic hinted at a possible new chip and showed off four colorways, including black/red, teal, white and transparent.

Anbernic hasn't announced a release date yet, but the company often starts selling its devices shortly after the first reveal video. Once available, the Anbernic RG DS will compete against the more premium Ayn Thor that starts at $250. It's important to note that Anbernic paused shipments from its Chinese warehouses to US customers in April following the tariff changes, meaning American buyers were limited to Anbernic's US stock. The previous notice has since been removed, but the Trump administration recently announced another retaliatory tariff on all Chinese goods.
