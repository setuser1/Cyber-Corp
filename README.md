Smart plugs can infuse some intelligence into regular old things around your home. When you're comfortable in bed, rather than getting up to turn off your light, you can connect it to a smart plug to control it from your phone or with your voice. They're some of the most affordable ways into the IoT world, but it's always great when you snag them on sale.

Right now, you can pick up the Amazon Smart Plug for a record-low price of $13, down from $25. The 48 percent discount comes as part of Amazon Prime Day sales. Prime members can even get a two-pack for $24 â€” 52 percent off its normal price.
