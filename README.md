Chrome is getting a new feature aimed at cutting back on notification overload. If enabled, Chrome can now revoke notification permission for websites that the user hasn't interacted with recently. It's a similar option to the automatic actions taken by Chrome's Safety Check for apps such as the camera or location information. The new feature will roll out to Chrome on both Android devices and on desktop.

Chrome revoking notifications

The browser will, ironically, notify you when a site is no longer going to send notifications. Once a site's permissions have been revoked, a user can re-enable them through Safety Check or by manually re-starting them from the site in question. If you don't want Chrome to ever take these actions for you, you can turn off the permissions revoking option completely.

Right now, Google said less than 1 percent of all notifications get any interactions from users. According to the company's internal tests, it found that receiving fewer overall notifications meant people were more likely to click on the alerts they did receive.
