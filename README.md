A federal judge has granted Meta-owned WhatsApps request for a permanent injunction blocking Israeli cyberintelligence company NSO Group from targeting the messaging apps users. At the same time, the judge dramatically reduced the fine that NSO Group must pay to Meta.

Earlier this year, a jury decided that the cyberintelligence company would have to pay Meta more than $167 million following a 2019 campaign that targeted more than 1,400 WhatsApp users, including human rights activists and journalists.
