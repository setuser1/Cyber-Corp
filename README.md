Home products company Kohler is launching a new Kohler Health division, and its first product is a $599 camera for your toilet. The item, dubbed Dekoda, is equipped with sensors that analyze whatever liquid or solid waste goes into the toilet bowl with "validated machine learning algorithms." The data, which can offer insights on hydration and gut health as well as detecting the presence of blood, then goes to Kohler Health's iPhone app, although Android support is in the works. It comes with a magnetic charging pad and a wall-mounted remote that can optionally use Bluetooth fingerprint authorization so that you don't learn way more than you want to about your guests.

I must salute the PR person who came up with this gem from the release: "By turning the bathroom into a connected, data-informed health and wellness hub, Kohler Health empowers individuals to turn ordinary routines into proactive, personalized experiences." Because who doesn't want to be proactive about pee? Health data is great, no arguments here. But this seems like a pretty extreme and expensive way to figure out if you're drinking enough water. Maybe I'm in the minority with my skepticism, however, because this isn't the first instance we've seen of toilet-bowl tech for better health. Withings introduced a monitor a few years back for analyzing urine streams, which you can buy for a mere $500.

If you're just that passionate about tracking your biometrics, Dekoda products are expected to ship starting tomorrow. You'll also need to sign up for a Kohler Health subscription on top of the product cost, and there are individual and family plan options.
