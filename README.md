WhatsApp is taking a new anti-spam feature for a spin. On Friday, TechCrunch reported that the trial limits the number of messages accounts can send without a reply from the recipient. The company is currently experimenting with different limits. But it's aiming for a number that only targets high-volume senders and spammers.

All messages from individuals and businesses are said to count toward this cap. That includes multiple unread ones sent to the same recipient. But if the person replies, those messages are removed from the monthly tally. WhatsApp will show a warning to accounts nearing the limit.

The company told TechCrunch that average users won't likely reach the limit. It's generally good form for individuals not to keep messaging people who don't reply anyway. So, the test indeed sounds tailor-made for businesses and spammers. The test will roll out in multiple countries over the coming weeks.

The trial is the Meta-owned company's latest attempt to fend off its festering spam and scam problem. Last year, it added the ability to unsubscribe from businesses' marketing messages. This August, it began notifying users when someone not in their contacts adds them to a group. Alongside that announcement, WhatsApp said it banned over 6.8 million accounts linked to scam centers in the first half of 2025.
