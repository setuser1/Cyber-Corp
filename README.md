Device maker Honor has revealed that one of its upcoming smartphones will offer an unusual design choice. While many manufacturers push to have more numerous and powerful cameras in their products, the Chinese company will put the camera for its new phone on a pop-out mechanical arm. According to CNBC, the design of this so-called "robot phone" is meant to showcase Honor's AI capabilities as the company makes a $10 billion investment in artificial intelligence over the next five years. Honor hasn't shared too much about this product, but will likely have more details during next year's Mobile World Congress.

Honor has experimented with unusual form factors before, including a surreally thin foldable smartphone and a laptop with a detachable webcam, and we've even seen a similar concept of a pop-up camera several years back in products like the OnePlus 7 Pro phone. The idea to swing out a camera could offer some interesting options for image and video capture, but it's also a prime place for mechanical failures and high manufacturing costs.
