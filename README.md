This year's fall Prime Day is almost on the books. But you still have time to save on some of our favorite tech. Yes, it's October and it's a little early to start thinking about holiday shopping. But it would be remiss to ignore the upcoming festivities entirely because you can actually save some money on good gadgets during this sale.

But let's be real: Amazon doesn't always make it easy to find what you're looking for. Amongst the pages and pages of bad deals you could sift through, you may come across a couple of actually good deals on tech that's worth your money to begin with. You don't have to go sifting through that nonsense though — that's where we come in. We've curated the top ten Prime Day deals on tech you should shop for before the event ends tonight. And no, not all of them will cost you an arm and a leg.

Apple AirTag 4 Pack

$65$99Save $34

See at Amazon

Apple AirTag (four-pack) for $65 (34 percent off): If you're an iPhone user, there are really no better Bluetooth trackers than AirTags. Attach one to your keys with an AirTag holder, slip one into your wallet or throw one into the bottom of your carry-on suitcase to monitor the location of your belongings using the Find My app. As is usually the case, picking them up in a multi-pack like this is cheaper than buying just one AirTag alone. And while you're at it, you can pick up a pair of Belkin AirTag holders for less thanks to Prime Day deals, too.

Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 75418

$31$45Save $14

Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 75418 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year.

PNY microSD Express card 128GB (Compatible with Nintendo Switch 2)

$38$45Save $7

See at Amazon

PNY microSD Express card (128GB) for $38 (15 percent off): This is really the first time we've seen Switch 2-compatible microSD Express cards on sale since they started coming out in earnest earlier this year. No, you unfortunately cannot just buy any microSD card on the market and use it with your new Switch 2. The console only works with these newer cards, and thankfully they are more available now than they were back in April when the Switch 2 went on pre-order for the first time. We've tested a good number of the cards on the market today and found that they're all pretty solid, so the best microSD card for Switch 2 is the microSD Express card you can most easily afford.

DJI Neo drone

$159$199Save $40

See at Amazon

DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but it has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. In our DJI Neo review, we praised it for its speediness and general ease of use, even for folks who have never operated a drone before. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off).

Anker Nano Portable Charger (5K)

$20$30Save $10

See at Amazon

Anker Nano portable charger (5K) with built-in USB connector for $20 ($10 off): Small? Check. Easy to use? Check. No need to remember a cable? Check. We tested this one for our battery guide and found it to be a good option for anyone who wants a no-fuss (and very compact) way to power up their phone on the go. It works particularly well with the latest iPhones, but it also works with other gear that carry USB-C charging ports.

Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber 2025

$38$50Save $12

See at Amazon

Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $38 (46 percent off): This is an updated version of my beloved Leebein electric scrubber, which has made cleaning my shower easier than ever before. I bought the old version not too long ago, and it's become one of the most used pieces of tech in my house. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C.

Anker Laptop Power Bank (25,000mAh 100W)

$90$135Save $45

See at Amazon

Anker Laptop Power Bank (25K 100W) for $90 ($45 off): This might be the only power bank you need if you're a commuter or you travel often. It's one of our favorites because it has a high enough capacity and wattage to power laptops (as its name suggests), and it has two built-in USB-C cables: one attached to the side, and a retractable one that extends up to two feet. That means you don't have to remember to bring a cable with you in your kit. It also has a handy display that shows the amount of charge the battery still has, and the output wattage flowing to your devices.

Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025

$24$40Save $16

See at Amazon

Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 (40 percent off): This is our top pick for the best streaming device for accessing free and live content. The dongle supports 4K video and HDR and doesnt need to be plugged into the wall for power. Its a great way to access any streaming service you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more. Plus, if you're not on the market for a new TV, it's also a good way to make an old set feel new again.

Xbox Game Pass Ultimate – 3 Month Membership

$57$60Save $3

See at Amazon

Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (3 months) for $57 ($33 off): Microsoft recently jacked up the price of Game Pass Ultimate to $30 per month, but you can get around that by stacking codes — at least, for now. Pick up this code for three months of the service at the old rate and you'll save some cash. Amazon's even offering a small discount on the typical $60 price.

Shark AI Ultra Robot Vacuum with Bagless Self Empty Base

$230$550Save $320

Shark AI robot vacuum with self-empty base for $230 (58 percent off): A version of one of our favorite robot vacuums, this Shark machine has strong suction power and supports home mapping.
