Days ahead of the next Pokémon game release, Centro Leaks is back with another batch of possible leaks about the franchise. The source claims that the same hacker behind last year's so-called Teraleak has released more information they obtained from datamining files owned by Pokémon developer Game Freak that shows the roadmap for all upcoming projects the company has in the works. And there appear to be quite a few of them.

This type of hacked information may not be an accurate reflection of Game Freak's actual plans, and any alleged details about the games may not appear in final iterations of the studio's titles. And even if these files are genuine, some of the planning documents are supposedly from 2020, so hardly the freshest info. With those caveats in mind, here's an overview of what the datamining revealed.

The leaker claims that the Gen 10 game will be called Pokémon Wind and Waves. Its theme is "infinity" and the project is slated for a 2026 release with a DLC planned for 2027. The datamine also revealed that an early build of the game treated the central area as an MMO-style lobby, where players could see and interact with each other as well as access quest boards. Wind and Waves could also have an MMO raid boss and may give players the ability to explore underwater. A bunch of other details about the plot, characters and mechanics may have been uncovered in the leak.

Pokémon Project Seed is not only the dream multi-region Pokémon game that people have always asked for, it also appears to be an MMO.

Other Pokémon projects reportedly in the works at Game Freak include another new Pokémon Legends game set in Galar that's slated for 2027 and beyond. A multi-region Pokémon remake, internally called Project Seed, may be released in 2028. The datamined leaks suggest this game also seems to be exploring some online multiplayer mechanics as well as letting players walk freely between different regions from past titles, which sure sounds like it could be a full-on Pokémon MMO. And Pokémon Pokopia is also apparently getting DLC.
