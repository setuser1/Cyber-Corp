Lenskart shares recovered after a soft start to finish slightly above the offer price on Monday, following the Indian eyewear retailers ₹72.8 billion ($821 million) IPO that sold out within hours but stirred debate over its valuation.

The stock opened at ₹395, below the IPO price of ₹402, and fell as much as 11% to ₹356.10 during the session before recovering to close at ₹404.55. The closing price valued Lenskart at about ₹702 billion (around $8 billion). The IPO was heavily oversubscribed with bids coming in at about 28 times the shares available, led primarily by institutional investors.
