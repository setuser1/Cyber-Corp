Electric aircraft startup Lilium may have ceased operations a year ago, but its insolvency filing wasnt quite the end of the German-based company.

There were multiple failed attempts to restructure the company, including a last-ditch effort by Mobile Uplift Corporation, a company set up by investors from Europe and North America, to acquire the operating assets of the startups two subsidiaries. Ultimately, a bankruptcy administrator put the companys assets through a competitive bid process.
