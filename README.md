Best record players (Billy Steele for Engadget)

Everyone knows by now that vinyl is back. The classic format has seen a resurgence for years at this point, and new albums these days almost always include a vinyl preorder. If youve finally decided to embark on the hobby, or if youre looking to upgrade your current setup, weve compiled a list of the best turntables you can buy for under $600. Obviously, there are some very good, very popular options out there for around $1,000, but we had to start somewhere, and we had to narrow down the options a bit. Plus, theres no reason for novices or even experienced spinners to spend that much to get a decent deck.

Best record player overall

Fluance RT85N Turntable

Drive: Belt | Cartridge: Nagaoka MP-110 | Platter: Acrylic | Preamp: No | Bluetooth: No

Fluances preference for a glossy finish may not be your first choice, but the RT85N should absolutely be on your radar as a purely analog turntable. Theres no preamp here, so youll need to buy one separately for this model. Youll get warm, expressive sound that caters to all the fine details of your record collection for highly enjoyable listening sessions.

Like other Fluance models, theres a solid MDF wood plinth equipped with adjustable resonance damping feet. On the RT85N, the company moved the motor from underneath the acrylic platter to prevent unwanted noise and vibrations. Theres also a Nagaoka MP-110 cartridge and elliptical diamond stylus that provide a substantial upgrade over the RT81+. Simplified controls and automatic stop help bridge the gap when beginners are ready to upgrade to a more advanced setup.

Pros

Warm, expressive sound

Isolated motor

Robust plinth with vibration-isolating, adjustable feet

Cons

Requires a separate preamp

Glossy finish isnt for everyone

U-Turn Audio Orbit Special (Gen 2)

Drive: Belt | Cartridge: Ortofon 2M Red | Platter: Grooved acrylic | Preamp: No (optional) | Bluetooth: No

If youre into minimal turntable designs that still look great, U-Turns Orbit line fits the bill. The company opts for a thinner plinth than most of the competition, offering a slimmed down look that I think is more sophisticated on the shelf. Theres also a range of colors and wood finishes available, so you can match your setup or cater to your style. The external drive belt will help reduce motor noise and unlike some of U-Turns models, you get electronic speed control here on the Orbit Special.

The company gives you the option to include a built-in preamp for an additional $80, but the Orbit Special I tested didnt have one (remember our $600 limit). I enjoyed the expressive, detailed sound here, rich with analog warmth. U-Turns Orbit Arm 3 is also a highlight, combining a one-piece magnesium armtube with an Ortogon 2M Red cartridge (with elliptical diamond stylus) and a cue lever. It has an adjustable counterweight and internal anti-skate as well. Lastly, the adjustable rubber feet are robust, providing ample cushioning from any vibrations that could impact playback.

Pros

Simple design

External drive belt

Expressive, detailed sound

Easily removable dust cover

Cons

No automatic stop

No ground wire connection

Wood finish costs more

Best record player for beginners

Audio-Technica AT-LP70XBT

Drive: Belt | Cartridge: AT-VM95C | Platter: Aluminum | Preamp: Yes | Bluetooth: Yes (aptX Adaptive)

I cut my teeth on an AT-LP60XBT, so I can vouch for how much of an upgrade the AT-LP70XBT is over that model. The audio improvements come from higher quality components like the cartridge, stylus, tonearm and three-piece construction. Simply put, the LP70XBT just looks more premium than the LP60XBT, and does so at a comparable price. Plus, you still get the fully automatic operation that will help beginners ease into their vinyl habit.

While the sound is crisp and clear on the LP70XBT, its not as full and immersive as some other turntables in this price range. The simple, straightforward controls are easy to master and theres no tonearm calibration required during the setup process. And if you dont have a need for Bluetooth connectivity, you can save yourself $70 and get all of the features I just mentioned on the regular AT-LP70X.

Pros

Fully automatic operation is good for beginners

Crisp, clear sound

Optional Bluetooth connection

Easily adjusts for 7-inch records

Cons

Better sound is available for less money

Youll probably want to upgrade the stylus quickly

Less-than-premium look

U-Turn Orbit Basic

Drive: Belt | Cartridge: Audio-Technica AT91B | Platter: MDF | Preamp: Yes (optional) | Bluetooth: No

The Orbit Basic offers a lot of U-Turns best turntable elements in a $249 package. And for $80 more, you can have a built-in preamp added straight from the factory like our test unit. This model features U-Turns simple yet sophisticated design thats available in several colors and two wood-grain options. You also get the companys OA3 gimbal tonearm with internal anti-skate and adjustable counterweight. However, theres no cue arm here and the tonearm is rather free swinging, so you have to be careful when placing it on a record.

The biggest downside to the Orbit Basic is the manual speed control. This requires you to physically move the belt on the external drive motor to change speeds from 33 to 45. Depending on your collection, you may not have to contend with that nuisance often. When it comes to playing music though, the Orbit Basic provides warm, crisp sound across a range of genres. The audio performance is best of any turntable we tested at this price, though the fully manual operation and lack of cue arm may present a bit of a learning curve to beginners.

Pros

Simple design

Optional preamp

Easily removable dust cover

Great sound quality for the price

Cons

Manual speed control

No cue arm

Freeswinging tonearm

Wood finish costs more

Best record player under $350

Fluance RT81+

Drive: Belt | Cartridge: Audio-Technica AT-VM95E | Platter: Aluminum | Preamp: Yes | Bluetooth: No

The sound quality on the RT81+ is nearly identical to that of the Alva ST, a turntable that costs more than twice as much. And here, you get robust, adjustable rubber feet to ensure your record player is sitting level. The solid MDF cabinet comes in an optional walnut wood veneer that looks nicer than the black and white options, but the high gloss finish may not appeal to everyone. I also enjoy the simple operation here, where you simultaneously turn the unit on and select speed with a single knob. The RT81+ also offers automatic stop (which you can disable) and an anti-skate system that arent always standard at this price.

Pros

Straightforward design

Automatic stop

Adjustable feet

Anti-skate system

Cons

Sound quality is good, not great

Glossy finish isnt for everyone

Other record players we tested

Audio-Technica AT-LP60XBT

This is about as basic as it gets, unless you opt for the AT-LP60X which ditches the Bluetooth connectivity. This is a perfectly decent option for someone just getting into vinyl, but if you spend a little more for the AT-LP70X, you wont be in quite as big of a hurry to upgrade once you surrender to the obsession.

Cambridge Audio Alva ST

The Alva ST has a refined design that made me want to keep it out in my living room longer than many of the models on this list. The controls are limited on the top to power and individual options for 33 and 45 RPM speeds. Everything else is on the back panel, including Bluetooth pairing and preamp buttons. To complete the look, Cambridge Audio opted for a 1mm aluminium top plate, which sits on an MDF plinth with a layer of EVA to absorb vibrations in between.

While the overall audio performance on the Alva ST is warm and inviting, there is a lack of detail across genres. Ive noticed albums dont have a particularly wide soundstage, and songs lack their normal punch at times, so some sound compressed compared to when theyre played on other turntables. Additionally, the free swinging tone arm needs more resistance so its not so prone to dropping on a record immediately if it slips out of your fingers when you have the cueing lever down. Since this turntable is fully manual operation, I felt a bit of peril every time I went to lower the needle. (The price increased during testing for this guide.)

Denon DP-300F

Denons DP-300F is a mixed bag. On one hand, you get the convenience of fully automatic operation, dedicated speed and record size buttons and somewhat refined design. There are also some confounding decisions though, like the permanently affixed cables, the preamp switch being under the platter and the overall midrange build quality for a $500 turntable. The sound from the preamp and Denons cartridge has a clear lack of depth and detail that almost any model at this price should offer.

How to shop for a turntable

The first question youll need to ask yourself when looking for a turntable is how you plan to use it. Are you into vinyl for the ritual? If you simply like the concept of physical media, having to flip a record to finish it or the need to intentionally swap out an album when its done, thats just fine. You probably can make do with a more affordable turntable since overall sound quality may not be a main concern. If you crave the warmth of analog sound, and you want the collection youve invested in to sound its best, youll need to consider something with better specs.

Youll also need to account for where and how youre going to listen to vinyl. Are you planning to connect this turntable to headphones or Bluetooth speakers? Do you have shelf or tower speakers youre going to use? Are you willing to invest in a dedicated preamp or would you rather a new turntable come with one built in? All of these questions will impact your buying decision — even the Bluetooth codecs, if youre going the wireless route.

Automatic, semi-auto and manual operation

If youre just getting into vinyl, an automatic turntable will save you a lot of stress. These are the models that place the stylus for you — all you have to do is push a button. When you get to the end of the record, the turntable will also return the tonearm to its resting spot automatically. Or, if you need to stop your session mid-side, theres a button for that too.

Some turntables have semi-automatic operation. Maybe they cant place the needle for you, but they do have an automatic stop when a side of a record is complete. This auto stop, which sometimes comes with an on/off switch, can prevent unnecessary wear on your stylus and vinyl. Plus, many turntables with automatic operation allow you to take control if you need to drop the stylus in a certain place (thats not the beginning of the record) or if you have a die-cut vinyl (like the It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown soundtrack).

Then theres the fully manual option. Here, youre solely responsible for placing the tonearm and taking it off when the music stops. A lot of turntables have a cue lever to assist with the process, and a lot of tonearms have a mechanism that lowers them slowly rather than violently dropping them on a record. This adds one more step to the ritual, and its one many purists prefer.

Preamp

The biggest decision youll need to make in terms of a preamp is to decide if you want one built into your turntable or if youd rather use a separate one. It can be very convenient, especially for beginners, to use a built-in component to amplify the signal from the turntable before it hits any speakers or headphones. The downside is that youre left with what the company provides from the factory, so if youre looking to upgrade, youll have to disable the preamp inside. On most turntables, theres a switch that allows you to do this, so its no trouble. But, opting to skip the preamp on some models could save you money that could be invested elsewhere.

A dedicated preamp typically uses higher-quality components and reduces noise by keeping internal parts properly separated. More robust models may even provide controls for things like tone or multiple inputs, while the basic options will simply allow you to plug in, play and forget it. If youre after the best possible clarity and realism from your record collection, wed recommend a dedicated preamp right from the start.

Removable cartridge/headshell

The next item youll want to consider is if the turntable youre eyeing can be upgraded in the future. The best way to do this is by swapping out the cartridge. Most turntables allow you to do this but there are some that dont, so youll need to pay attention to this detail. Upgrading the cartridge down the road is a great way to improve overall sound quality without having to buy a new turntable, new speakers or a new amp.

Belt drive vs. direct drive

There are two main types of turntables: belt drive and direct drive. All of the models we tested for this guide are belt drive, which means theres a thin belt that connects the platter to the motor to make the thing spin. Direct drive turntables are widely used by DJs and Technics was the first to make them. Here, the motor is directly under the platter and connected to it directly so the setup is less prone to wearing out. This is especially key when youre doing things like scratching. Direct-drive turntables tend to be more expensive than their belt-driven counterparts.

Counterweight and anti-skate control

Most turntables will include a counterweight on the tonearm and some form of anti-skate control. Both of these help keep the stylus in place with the correct amount of pressure, all to ensure proper operation with minimal wear on your records. Sometimes the anti-skate elements are built into the tonearm while other models offer a dedicated dial on the surface of the plinth. The ability to adjust both of these can help you fine-tune the performance of your turntable over time, which may be necessary after upgrading the cartridge or other components.

Other components to consider

Some final items youll want to evaluate on a prospective turntable purchase include the materials used for the base (plinth), platter and even the feet. Cheaper turntables may be mostly plastic affairs while more expensive models can use solid MDF (medium-density fibreboard) for the plinth. A lot of turntables have aluminum platters with a felt pad while others may feature a thick acrylic version. And while entry-level turntables may have small, plastic feet, premium models come with larger, adjustable, rubberized feet for better vibration isolation. While some of these come down to personal preference — a frosted acrylic platter looks really nice — there are some performance boosts to be gained depending on how the company uses the components.

How we test turntables

Since most turntables under $600 meet the criteria for entry-level through midrange, we tested every model with a set of Audio-Technica AT-SP3X powered speakers. These offer balanced sound for turntables with a 1.1-inch tweeter and 3-inch woofer in each unit. And at $269, they wont break the bank if you need speakers for your new turntable and theyll provide ample sound performance even if you spend more than our budget on a new deck.

For all of our test units that didnt have a built-in preamp, we used the Fluance PA-10. At $100, its an affordable upgrade if youre looking to bypass a turntables included components or if youre looking to go more analog with your turntable purchase. There are no buttons or controls, just connect your turntable, speakers and ground wire (if youre using one) and youre ready to go. Its simple, straightforward and inexpensive, so its a great option for beginners and more experienced vinyl collectors alike.

In terms of performance testing, we play a variety of genres on each turntable to evaluate sound quality. We also carefully examine the overall experience of putting a record on, setting the speed, placing the tonearm and more, which allows us to judge how well each turntable will work for users at different experience levels. Lastly, we take notes on design and components, comparing those elements from each turntable with our other test subjects to make our recommendations.
