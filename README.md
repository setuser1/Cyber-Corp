Snapchat is making its new &#8220;Imagine Lens,&#8221; the companys first open prompt image-generation AI Lens, available to all users for free. The Lens was initially launched in September but only for paid subscribers. With the Lens, users can edit their own Snaps using custom prompts or generate their own.

For instance, you could prompt the app, &#8220;Turn me into an alien&#8221; after snapping a selfie, or request an image of a &#8220;grumpy cat.&#8221; The company suggests you could use the Lens to try on Halloween costume ideas, or reimagine your friend in a new look, among other things.
