Slack/Salesforce

I've been using Slack for like a decade and the platform's proprietary chatbot, Slackbot, has always been a bit underwhelming. It can deliver reminders and notifications and, well, that's about it. That could change in the near future, as the platform is testing a redesigned Slackbot that's chock full of AI.

The new Slackbot is basically an AI chatbot like all the rest, but this one has been purpose-built to help with common work tasks. Folks can use natural language to converse with the bot and it can do stuff like whip up project plans, flag daily priorities and analyze reports. It can also help people find information when they only remember a few scant details. The company says it will "give every employee AI superpowers" so they can "drive productivity at AI speed."

To that end, the new Slackbot integrates with tools like Google Drive, Salesforce and One Drive. It can provide "clear insights" by analyzing those other platforms. Slack also says that the chatbot will continue to grow and evolve, eventually being able to "take action on your behalf and build agents at your request, all with no code required."

The Verge got a look at the new Slackbot in action and noted that it helped create a social media campaign using a brand's tone and organized a product's launch plan. The publication didn't indicate if the social media campaign and product launch plan were any good.

The redesigned and AI-centric Slackbot is currently available as a beta to 70,000 users, but Slack has plans for a broad rollout by the end of the year. Companies will be able to turn off the feature, but all of us individual worker bees won't have that luxury.

This is just the latest AI injection by Slack. After all, parent company Salesforce absolutely loves the technology. Slack recently added AI writing assistance to its Canvas document-sharing space and introduced AIâ€‘generated channel recaps and thread summaries. It also recently came out that the company has been using people's chats to train its AI models by default, with companies being forced to specifically request an opt-out.
