The iterative upgrades for iPads may not be enticing enough to warrant a new purchase every year, but Apple may have a particularly cool upgrade to convince users to shell out for the next iPad Pro. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple is planning to include a vapor chamber for the upcoming iPad Pro that's due to ship with the M6 chip.

We've already seen the vapor chamber included in the iPhone 17 Pro models, helping to boost cooling and performance. While an iPad's larger surface area makes for greater heat dissipation than an iPhone, this cooling system should make the tablet more capable when it comes to demanding tasks, like gaming, video editing or AI apps. Gurman also predicts that Apple could market the vapor chamber cooling as another way to differentiate between the iPad models.

Apple previously improved the cooling performance of iPad Pros with the M4 generation, which included a new copper heat sink. With the vapor chamber, Apple is borrowing a concept already found in other smartphones from Samsung and Google. Samsung has even included this style of liquid cooling in its Galaxy Tab S9, which came out in 2023. As for the first potential iPad Pro with a vapor chamber, Gurman said he expects Apple to follow its typical 18-month release schedule, meaning the M6 iPad Pro with improved heat performance could come out sometime in 2027.
