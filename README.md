We finally have a release date for Mouse: P.I. for Hire. The delightfully animated game, which marks Troy Baker's first time playing a rodent private eye, is slated for March 19, 2026.

Based on its trailers, you'd be forgiven for viewing Mouse: P.I. for Hire as Cuphead meets Doom. Although it does include FPS action, Engadget's Jessica Conditt discovered surprising depth behind its whimsical brutality. The game "has more to offer than shock-value cartoon violence," she wrote. "This is a clue-gathering, photo-snapping, girlfriend-avenging, noir detective simulator that happens to star a bunch of slick-talking mice and rats, and I'm fully into it."

Baker plays Private Investigator Jack Pepper, the game's protagonist. When he isn't hunting clues or sneaking around during the game's quieter moments, he'll have a delightful arsenal on hand. This includes wacky ones like a turpentine gun that melts the inked "skin" of your foes. Fun stuff.

Like Cuphead, Mouse's most obvious point of comparison, it uses hand-drawn frames to recreate that old-school style. It also deploys an original jazz soundtrack recorded by an orchestral ensemble. It's all presented in a gritty, film noir aesthetic.

You can check out the release date trailer below. Mouse: P.I. for Hire will launch next March on PC, Switch 2, Switch, PS5/4, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One.
