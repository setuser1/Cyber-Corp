Although LLM-powered AI agents are a fairly new phenomenon, one of the areas where theyve been most popular so far is in sales. 1Mind, a startup co-founded by Amanda Kahlow, has been quietly shipping its sales agent, named Mindy, for about a year.

On Monday, the startup announced a $30 million Series A round led by Battery Ventures. This brings 1Minds total raise to $40 million, the company says.
