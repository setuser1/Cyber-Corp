We generally consider Apples iPads to be the best tablets for most people, but most of them dont come cheap. To help you get the most value possible, were keeping a constant eye on sale prices and rounding up the best iPad deals we can find each week.

This week has been a particularly fruitful time to be in the market for an Apple tablet: Amazon held its latest Prime Day sale on October 7-8, while other retailers like Best Buy, Target and Walmart are still running sweeping sales of their own. A number of Apple device discounts from these events are still available today, including the base iPad (A16) for $279 and a $150 drop for the iPad Air. Beyond iPads, other gadgets like the AirPods 4, MacBook Air and AirTag remain heavily discounted as well. Here are all the top deals on Apple gear we could find this week.

Apple iPad (A16)

$279$349Save $70

The latest entry-level iPad comes with a faster A16 chip, 2GB more RAM and 128GB of storage by default. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need a tablet for roaming the internet, watching shows and doing some lighter productivity tasks, it should do the job. With the recent iPadOS 26 update, it also has most of the same multitasking features available on the more expensive models. It does lack Apple Intelligence, but to be candid, that isn't a big loss right now. This discount is only a few bucks off the lowest price we've seen for the base model, but other storage configurations are $120 off as well. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.

$279 at Amazon

Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off MSRP): The most recent iPad Air is a relatively minor update, as the only major addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend the Air over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is laminated, more color-rich and better at fending off glare (though it's still 60Hz); its speakers are more robust; it works with Apples best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. We saw the base model drop as low as $437 during Amazon's Prime Day sale this week, but this $150 discount ties the best price we've seen otherwise. Other configurations are also $150 off. Also at Best Buy.

Apple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nate Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart but is otherwise the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for multitasking or just taking in movies. This discount is an all-time low, and it applies to several color options and storage configs. Also at Best Buy.

Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The 8.3-inch iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. The newest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — alongside 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. Youd buy it if you want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. We saw it available for $20 less during Amazon's Prime Day sale, but this is still a decent drop from its typical going rate. Also at Best Buy.

Apple AirPods 4 with ANC

$119$179Save $60

This version of the AirPods 4 adds active noise cancellation (ANC), a wireless charging case and Find My tracking support. They have the same open-style design, so the ANC isn't as effective as what you'd get with a pair that fully seals off the ear canal, but it still makes the earbuds a bit more useful in noisy areas. We gave this pair a score of 86 in our review. This deal matches the best price we've seen. Also at Walmart.

$119 at Amazon

Apple AirPods 4 for $89 ($40 off): If you don't need ANC, the standard AirPods 4 are still a good buy for those who hate the feeling of pairs that jut into their ear canal. They lack built-in volume controls, and no open-style earbuds can produce the same level of bass response as traditional in-ear headphones, but they generally sound more pleasant than most pairs of this type, and they still offer a host of Apple-friendly features. This is another all-time low. Also at Walmart, or Best Buy for $1 more.

Apple AirTags (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off): We may see an updated model by the end of the year, but the current AirTags are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone owners right now thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultra-wideband tech that makes it easy to locate nearby items. Just note that you'll need a separate AirTag holder to attach them to your keys, wallet or bag. This deal comes within a dollar of the lowest price we've seen for a four-pack. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. If you just want one, individual AirTags are a bit cheaper than usual at $20 as well.

Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This discount ties the all-time low for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, but configs with more memory and storage are $200 off as well. Also at Best Buy.

Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but has better speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. The notebook very briefly fell as low as $969 earlier this week, but this is a solid drop all the same. Other configs are similarly discounted. Also at Best Buy.

Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The top-end option in Apples confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apples double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. Its a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that its only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a fine discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.

Apple AirPods Max for $429 ($120 off): The AirPods Max are bulkier and older than Sonys WH-1000XM6 — the top pick in our guide to the best wireless headphones — plus they rely on a weirdly flimsy case to preserve power, so we only recommend them to hardcore Apple fans. That said, their ANC and warm sound profile still rank among the better options on the market, and they offer most of the same handy features as the in-ear AirPods. This model is virtually the same as the pair we reviewed way back in 2020, only it has a USB-C port and supports lossless audio with a cable. This discount is $30 off the pairs lowest-ever price, but its the biggest drop weve seen since July.

Apple iMac (M4) for $1,149 ($150 off): We like the M4 iMac as an all-in-one computer thanks to its powerful performance, standard 16GB of RAM and improved webcam. Just note that it only comes in a 24-inch screen size option. This deal on the base model isn't quite an all-time low, but it's roughly $40 lower than the desktop's usual street price and a decent savings compared to buying directly from Apple. Also at Best Buy.

Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS, 42mm) for $389 ($10 off): The latest flagship Apple Watch only hit the market last month, but Amazon is already selling it for $10 off. It doesn't show up as a percentage off, but you'll see some models listed at $389 instead of Apple's $399 MSRP. If you're new to Apple's wearables or are ready to upgrade from a Series 9 or older, this is a good model to grab. If you're coming from a Series 10, however, there's not much need to upgrade as the only major change from last year's model is a slightly larger battery and a tougher screen.

Apple Watch SE 3 (GPS, 40mm) for $240 ($9 off): There's a similar stealth discount for the newest budget model, the Apple Watch SE 3, at Amazon. It normally goes for $249 — again, not a big discount, but better than nothing if you're looking to get onboard early. Apple gave this model some badly needed updates compared to its predecessor, including an always-on display, faster charging, better sensors and the same processor that you'll find in the new Apple Watch Series 11.
