Spotify has been spotted developing a &#8220;SongDNA&#8221; feature that would allow users to discover music through the credits &#8212; the writers, collaborators, vocalists, engineers, lyricists, producers, composers, and others who worked on a given track or album.

The feature was discovered in the apps code by reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong, who was able to generate screenshots of how SongDNA would appear in the app. Based on her findings, SongDNA would introduce a visual experience where you could essentially navigate through the credits, see how people were connected to each other, and explore their various works.
