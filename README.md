Elon Musk will settle a $128 million lawsuit with four Twitter executives he fired after taking over the company in 2022.

One of Musks first moves upon buying Twitter was to fire CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, and top lawyers Sean Edgett and Vijaya Gadde. The four executives never received severance payments, which they claim is because they tried to hold Musk to his $44 billion commitment when he tried to back out of buying the company. The lawsuit even quotes Walter Isaacsons biography of Musk, which quotes him as saying that he would &#8220;hunt every single one&#8221; of Twitters C-suite &#8220;till the day they die.&#8221;
