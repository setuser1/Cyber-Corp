YouTube is adding a timer to Shorts so you don't scroll the day away

It's set by the user and causes a pop-up to appear on the screen.

YouTube is adding a timer to Shorts to help curb all of that incessant doomscrolling, according to a report by TechCrunch. This feature is rolling out to all users after being spotted in an Android APK file earlier this year, which was originally reported on by Android Authority.

Here's how it works. Users set a daily time limit for Shorts via the app's settings. Once reached, they'll see a pop-up reminding them to take a break. This pop-up is easily dismissed with a tap, but it's the thought that counts. At the very least, it'll remind people of just how long they've been laying in bed and watching random Curb Your Enthusiasm clips.

This doesn't currently integrate with parental controls, but that's coming next year. At that point, parents or guardians will be able to set specific time limits on how long kids can scroll the Shorts feed. That pop-up will not be dismissible by children.

This isn't the first move by YouTube to help improve digital well-being. There's a way to set "take a break" reminders at various increments, and the same goes for a pop-up at bedtime.

Why the renewed focus on limiting user engagement? Well, there are nearly 2,000 lawsuits floating around right now directed toward social media companies, according to a report by Bloomberg Law. Many of these suits accuse the companies of intentionally designing their platforms to be addictive.
