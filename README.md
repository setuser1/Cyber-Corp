Periodic Labs, a new startup by one of OpenAIs most respected researchers, Liam Fedus, and his former Google Brain colleague, Ekin Dogus Cubuk, came out of stealth last month with an enormous $300 million seed round. It was led by  Felicis and included a whos who of angels and other top VCs.

The startup began when Fedus had a conversation with Cubuk (whose friends call him &#8220;Doge&#8221;) about seven months ago. Cubuk was one of Google Brains foremost machine learning and material science researchers. After endless Silicon Valley takes on how generative AI would radically change scientific discovery, they decided that the pieces were finally in place to make this a reality. Or at least to found a startup that attempted it.
