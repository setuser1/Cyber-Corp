OxygenOS 16 combines customization features from iOS with AI capabilities from Android.

OnePlus has finally shown off its take on Android 16. OxygenOS 16, first shipping on the upcoming OnePlus 15, combines the new customization options of Android, with smoother animations and a take on AI that seems directly lifted from Nothing OS.

The centerpiece of OxygenOS 16 is a deeper integration between OnePlus' "Mind Space" app and Google Gemini. Mind Space debuted alongside the Plus Key — the replacement for OnePlus' classic Alert Slider — on some OnePlus 13 phones earlier this year. Like Nothing's Essential Space, it captures screenshots and voice memos and automatically sorts them into folders you can refer to later. The big innovation of OxygenOS 16 is that you can now ask Gemini to refer to content in Mind Space to personalize responses. The idea being that the added context will make the AI assistant's responses more helpful.

OnePlus is also hopping on the AI writing and photo editing bandwagon. AI Writer in OxygenOS 16 can convert text into mind maps and tables with a few taps, and also generate social media captions based on a photo. The usual options for proofreading and summarizing text are also built-in. For photos, OnePlus is adding what it calls AI Portrait Glow to make faces visible even in poor lighting conditions and AI Perfect Shot, which appears to combine multiple photos to generate a single image where everyone's eyes are open, like Google's Best Take feature.

Beyond those AI-enabled features, OnePlus says it's also improving customization options and animations across OxygenOS. With OxygenOS 16 you'll be able to customize your lock screen with a variety different fonts and layouts, including the option to convert a still image into an animated GIF or use a video lock screen. On your home screen, OxygenOS 16 is also getting a collection of new widgets and the ability to scale app icons — another idea present in Nothing OS. Opening and moving between apps should also feel smoother thanks to new, speedier animations and an update to how the OS loads content. Essentially, with Parallel Processing 2.0, OxygenOS 16 "allows new animations to begin before previous actions complete," which is supposed to make everything feel more fluid.

Those are just the highlights of OxygenOS 16, which also includes an expansion of the tablet multitasking system OnePlus uses on its OnePlus Pad tablets, and new connectivity options that let you mirror your phone screen to macOS or Windows computers.

OxygenOS 16 will be released alongside the OnePlus 15, which doesn't have a release date, but is expected to launch this fall. The new OS update will also be available on recent OnePlus devices starting in November 2025, like the OnePlus 13, OnePlus Pad 3 and OnePlus Open. A full list of compatible devices is available on OnePlus' website.
