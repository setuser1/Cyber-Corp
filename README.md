The guests sipped prosecco andÂ chattered away while dessert was served at the third annual Project Health Minds Gala on Thursday night in New York.

The evening was winding down, but there was still one big award to give out: Humanitarian of the Year, which this year would be honoring Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, for creating The Parents Network through their nonprofit Archewell Foundation. The Parents Network supports families who have been harmed by social media.
