Theres a surprising number of deals on Amazons site for gadgets, accessories and small electronics that weve tested and recommend. If youre looking for mini speakers to keep you company by the fire pit, a new cable that wont conk out on you or a smart plug to control your Halloween lights, check out this list. Weve linked to our buying guides and reviews so you can read up on a product before plunking down your hard-earned (but less than 25) dollars. Here are Engadgets picks for the best October Prime Day tech deals under $25.

The best Prime Day deals under $25

Amazon

Amazon Smart Plug

$13$25Save $12

Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener.

Blink Mini 2 security camera for $20 ($20 off): This is the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside.

Samsung EVO Select microSD card (128GB) for $13 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. The larger-capacity 256GB model is on sale for $23, but the 128GB is a better gigs-to-dollars deal.

Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level.

Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $19 ($16 off): Heres what we named the best budget streaming stick. At a price this low and only an HD resolution, you shouldnt expect a premium picture, but if you just want a quick way to get your streaming apps up and running on a basic screen, this will do the thing.

Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you dont care about 4K (or your screen resolution isnt that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS that we liked in our guide with this device. The best thing about Roku devices is the access to all the free content â€” and this is an affordable way to get it.

Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhoods Ring-captured events.

Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazons lineup. The sound wont be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexas help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year.

JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the apps preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours.
