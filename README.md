Energy startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) said Thursday its working with Googles DeepMind division to fine tune — and even improve — the operation of its forthcoming Sparc reactor using AI.

The companies plan will simulate the plasma that will burn inside CFSs reactor using specialized DeepMind software known as Torax. They also plan on pairing Torax with AI models to help CFS figure out how best to achieve fusion power.
