Google announced on Tuesday that Google Fi, its telecommunications service, is getting several new updates, including AI noise filters and RCS web messaging.

The tech giant says calls will now use AI-enhanced audio to reduce background noise and improve voice clarity, even when speaking to someone on a landline or older device. The company says the update should allow for &#8220;more natural-sounding conversations.&#8221;
