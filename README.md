Your spot on the expo floor is the catalyst that moves the needle

Real investor exposure: Were talking foot traffic from the likes of Sequoia, a16z, General Catalyst, Khosla Ventures, and more. They walk the floor. You want them to stop at your table.

A powerful brand moment: Your company gets featured as a partner on the event page, the Disrupt app, and across the venue, giving you visibility beyond the booth.

Traction that sticks: Many exhibitors walk away with early customers, game-changing intros, or unexpected media attention.

Built-in perks: Each table comes with 10 comped passes for you and your team, marked as a Silver Tier partner, and more. See all the perks of exhibiting here.

Book your table now before its taken by your competitor! The deadline is in less than 5 days, October 17.
