Controversial dating safety apps, Tea and TeaOnHer, have been pulled from the Apple App Store. The apps removal was first spotted by the app store intelligence provider Appfigures, which told TechCrunch the two apps were removed from the App Store on Tuesday in all markets but remain live on Google Play.

Reached for comment, Apple confirmed the apps removal, saying it removed Tea Dating Advice and TeaOnHer from the App Store because they failed to meet Apples requirements around content moderation and user privacy. The company also said it saw an excessive number of user complaints and negative reviews, which included complaints of minors personal information being posted in these apps.
