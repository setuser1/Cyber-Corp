Tesla reintroduces 'Mad Max' Full Self-Driving mode that breaks speed limits

Tesla has added another brazenly stupid new entry to its dubious safety record. The latest update to Tesla's Full Self-Driving System adds a mode called Mad Max, "which comes with higher speeds and more frequent lane changes" than the system's Hurry mode. This feature isn't new; it was part of the Autopilot mode in 2018 that pre-dated FSD. According to Electrek, the re-introduction of Mad Max mode is going exactly as well as you'd expect: "It hasnt been out for 24 hours, and it has already been spotted rolling stop signs and driving more than 15 mph (24 km/h) over the speed limit."

Everything about this is a comically bad idea, or it would be comic if it wasn't so downright dangerous. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration just opened an investigation into the company's FSD system last week after receiving more than 50 reports of traffic safety violations in addition to numerous crashes. And this is just the most recent time the regulator has put FSD in its crosshairs. Choosing this moment to reintroduce an automated driving mode based on a post-apocalyptic wasteland where life is meaningless is a level of arrogance that does feel on brand for Tesla.
