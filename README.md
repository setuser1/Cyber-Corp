On Wednesday, Anthropic released Claude Haiku 4.5, the newest version of its smallest model, billed as offering similar performance to Sonnet 4 &#8220;at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed,&#8221; per a company blog post.

Anthropic cites a range of new benchmark results to back up those performance claims. In the companys testing, Haiku scored 73% on SWE-Bench verified and 41% on the command-line-focused Terminal-Bench â€” below Sonnet 4.5, but on par with Sonnet 4, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 in each case. Tests show similar results on benchmarks for tool use, computer use, and visual reasoning.
