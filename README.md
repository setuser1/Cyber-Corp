Semiconductor design company Arm is partnering up with Meta to enhance the social media giants AI systems amid an unprecedented infrastructure buildout. Under the partnership, Metas ranking and recommendation systems will move to Arms Neoverse platform, which was recently optimized for AI systems in the cloud, among other implementations.

&#8220;AI is transforming how people connect and create,&#8221; Santosh Janardhan, Metas head of infrastructure, said in a statement. &#8220;Partnering with Arm enables us to efficiently scale that innovation to the more than 3 billion people who use Metas apps and technologies.&#8221;
