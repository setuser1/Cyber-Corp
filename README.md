Notably, Campaign Evolved is built in Unreal Engine 5. Halo Studios announced it would focus on Unreal development when it rebranded from 343 Industries in 2024. Besides the new visuals and controls, the remake will also include tweaks to memorable missions from the original game as a way to better onboard new players into Halos world.

“We wanted to start where it all began, with the original campaign that defined Halo,” producer Damon Conn said in the blog post announcing the game. “Starting here means people that have never played the game before will be able to understand the story from the very beginning, and that can help us chart a course forward with new Halo stories.”

Halo: Campaign Evolved will be available in 2026 for Xbox Series X / S, PS5 and PC.
