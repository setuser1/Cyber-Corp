If your laptop simply isnt cutting it anymore, October Prime Day might have arrived just in time. As has been the case for the past few years, laptop deals are abundant for Amazon's Big Deal Days, bringing discounts to MacBooks, Windows laptops, Chromebooks and more. But we wouldnt blame you if you didnt know how to figure out if that laptop youre eyeing actually has a good discount for Prime Day, or if the deal is stale.

Thats where Engadget can help. Weve poured over the Prime Day laptop deals available this year to pick out the best ones you can get across all kinds of computers. If youre super picky about the specs you want in a new laptop, we always recommend going straight to the manufacturer so you can configure the machine exactly to your needs. But if youre willing to work with premade models, these Prime Day laptop deals could help you save some cash on your next machine.

Best Prime Day laptop deals: MacBooks

Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4)

$899$999Save $100

See at Amazon

Apples latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, and we recommend getting those if you want a device thats as future-proof as possible at the moment. Youll find decent MacBook deals on Amazon throughout the year, and most of them will be on the base configurations. In a welcomed update earlier this year, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as youll find on the base-level Pros).

Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $1,078 (10 percent off)

Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4) for $1,399 (13 percent off)

Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4) for $2,249 (10 percent off)

Best Prime day laptop deals: Windows laptops

Youve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 16GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If youre looking for a new gaming laptop, youll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot.

Acer Aspire 3 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i3) for $400 (11 percent off)

HP Ultrabook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100) for $280 (20 percent off)

Best Prime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks

Most Chromebooks are already pretty cheap, but that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. However, there are a ton of premium Chromebooks available today that didnt exist even three years ago, so now is a great time to look out for discounts on those models. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver.

Lenovo Ideapad 3 Chromebook (15-inch, Intel Celeron) for $230 (77 percent off)

HP HD Chromebook (15-inch, Intel Pentium N200) for $287 (18 percent off)

Acer Chromebook Plus (14-inch, Intel Core i3) for $360 (10 percent off)
