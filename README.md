Instagram head Adam Mosseri said AI will change who can be creative, as the new tools and technology will give people who couldnt be creators before the ability to produce content at a certain quality and scale. However, he also admitted that bad actors will use the technology for &#8220;nefarious purposes&#8221; and that kids growing up today will have to be taught that you cant believe something just because you saw a video of it.

The Meta executive shared his thoughts on how AI is impacting the creator industry at the Bloomberg Screentime conference this week. At the interviews start, Mosseri was asked to address the recent comments from creator MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson). On Threads, MrBeast had suggested that AI-generated videos could soon threaten creators livelihoods and said it was &#8220;scary times&#8221; for the industry.
