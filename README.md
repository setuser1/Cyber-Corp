For the release of her twelfth album, &#8220;The Life of a Showgirl,&#8221; Taylor Swift sent fans on an online scavenger hunt this weekend, which began by searching for &#8220;Taylor Swift&#8221; on Google. But as fans unveiled secret videos as part of the campaign, some fretted that the clips looked like they were AI-generated &#8212; and they were not pleased.

A Google search for the singers name yields a cryptic message: &#8220;12 cities, 12 doors, 1 video to unlock.&#8221;
