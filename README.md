Shuttered robot vacuum maker Neato is ending cloud services sooner than planned

The company said in 2023 that cloud services would stay running for at least five years.

Starting soon, Neato robovac owners will no longer be able to control their devices using the app. Neato Robotics, which shut down in 2023 due to declining sales, has notified customers that "cloud services are being phased out during Q4 2025," according to an email obtained by The Verge.

While Neato's parent company Vorwerk Group initially said cloud support would continue for at least five years following its closure, the email now says "cybersecurity standards, compliance obligations, and regulations have advanced in ways that make it no longer possible to safely and sustainably operate these legacy systems." This doesn't mean existing Neato products will be completely bricked — there's still the option to start them manually by pressing a button — but they won't offer all the smart home conveniences expected from a robovac that cost hundreds of dollars. Without use of the app, customers won't be able to set cleaning schedules, remotely start the vacuums or assign No-go zones.
