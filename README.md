While Apples iPhone already supports texting, calling emergency services, and contacting roadside assistance via satellite connectivity, the company has many more satellite-powered features in the works, according to Bloombergs Mark Gurman.

In-development features reportedly include an API allowing app makers to support satellite connections in their own apps, a version of Apple Maps that allows users to navigate without a cell or WiFi connection, adding photos to messaging, and increased support for “natural usage,” allowing users to connect to a satellite even if their phone isnt pointed directly at the sky.
