The Commodore 64 is back in black, sort of. Retro Games and Plaion Replai released a limited edition redesign of the best-selling computer, called THEC64 - Black Edition. Like its name suggests, the console is a modernized version of the classic Commodore 64 in an all-black shell.

THEC64 - Black Edition will come with 25 pre-installed games, but unlike the company's previous consoles, this one will feature "neo-retro" games from C64 developers who have designed new games on the old-school architecture. Once you finish all the new titles like Sam's Journey, A Pig Quest and Hessian, you can plug in your own USB drive to play custom games. According to Retro Games, the updated redesign comes with four save slots per game, plug-and-play HDMI compatibility and a USB joystick.

If you want THEC64 - Black Edition to feel more like the original Commodore 64, you can plug in a keyboard through the USB port. However, Retro Games also designed a non-mini THEC64 that has a fully functional keyboard. The latest blacked-out version is now available on Amazon or Retro Games' website for $119.99.
