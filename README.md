City Hall meets the startup community at Disrupt

Daniel Lurie, who campaigned on revitalizing the citys economy and restoring its global standing, isnt just glad-handing; his presence underscores an overdue détente between City Hall and the startup community, which is currently experiencing an AI-driven renaissance even as the city grapples with pandemic aftershocks. Empty downtown offices and escalating skepticism about techs impact have strained the relationship, but the AI boom has brought renewed energy — and investment — back to the city.
