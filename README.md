Wireless headphones have come a long way from the bulky designs of the past. Todays models are lighter, smarter and packed with features that make them useful for everything from travel to long workdays at your desk. Many offer strong noise cancellation, quick pairing and reliable battery life — all of which makes them an easy upgrade if you want more freedom from your devices.

Of course, not every listener has the same needs. Some people want portability, which is why our guide to the best earbuds is worth a look, while others want something more specialized like the best gaming headsets or the best budget earbuds. But if youre after over-ear headphones that focus on comfort and immersive sound, this roundup of the best wireless headphones highlights the top choices weve tested.

Best wireless headphones overall

Sony WH-1000XM6

Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Battery life: 30 hours | Weight: 0.55 pounds | Water resistance: None | Assistant support: Bixby, Siri, Google Assistant | Color options: Black, Platinum Silver, and Midnight Blue

Read our full Sony WH-1000XM6 review

Sonys 1000X line has been our top pick for best wireless headphone for a long time now. Until another company can pack in as many premium features as Sony, and do so with a mix of excellent sound quality and effective ANC, the crown is safe. With the WH-1000XM6, Sony subtly redesigned its flagship headphones, making them way more comfortable to wear for long periods of time. This is an important factor to consider when purchasing over-ear headphones. We also noticed in our tests that the company made noticeable improvements to the active noise cancellation, thanks to a new QN3 chip. There are now 12 total ANC mics as well – the previous model only had eight. This all combines to better block background noise at medium and high frequencies, including human voices.

The M6 also has improved sound quality, thanks to new drivers, some help from mastering engineers and spatial audio upmixing. Its battery life remains the same 30 hours as its predecessor, which is more than enough to get you through several days of work or long international flights. Speak-to-Chat still reduces volume and activates ambient sound when you talk and the M6 can automatically change noise settings based on your location or activity. The only real downside is that theyre $50 more than the WH-1000XM5 at full price ($450).

Pros

Improved sound

Better ANC performance

Tons of handy features

Supremely comfy

Cons

Price has increased again

Speak-to-Chat still needs work

Call quality suffers in loud environments

Best wireless headphones - best sound quality

Sennheiser HDB 630

Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Battery life: 60 hours | Weight: 0.68 pounds | Water resistance: None | Assistant support: Bixby, Siri, Google Assistant | Color options: Black

Read our full Sennheiser HDB 630 review

Audiophile sound quality when youre on the go typically requires a set of wired headphones and a DAC (digital-to-analog converter). Its not the most convenient way to listen to tunes. Sennheiser bridges the gap between compressed audio on wireless headphones and those cumbersome setups with the HDB 630. Thanks to a USB-C dongle, you get higher resolution sound with all the benefits of wireless ANC headphones.

Sennheiser offers up to 24-bit/96kHz resolution wirelessly, and you have the option for lossless audio over USB-C as well. Theres also plenty of fine-tuning available on a highly detailed EQ and a Crossfeed feature allows you to blend the left and right channels for more natural sound. Plus, the HDB 630 has a whopping 60 hours of battery life with ANC active, although that figure drops to a still respectable 45 hours when you enable those high-quality tracks.

Pros

Outstanding sound quality

High-res streaming dongle included

Lossless audio over USB-C

Extremely long battery life

Cons

Expensive

Basic design with lots of plastic

Best audio performance requires extra steps

Best wireless headphones - best sound quality runner up

Noble Audio FoKus Apollo

Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Battery life: 60 hours | Weight: 11.5 ounces | Water resistance: None | Assistant support: Google Assistant, Siri | Color options: Black/Silver

Read our full Noble Audio FoKus Apollo review

Noble Audio utilizes a unique driver configuration to provide more detailed sound than the competition. Instead of a single driver, the company uses two: one dynamic and one planar magnetic. The result is the FoKus Apollo getting the best of both, with thick bass, clear highs and extreme clarity.

You wont find a lot of features here. There is decent ANC performance, but its nowhere near the best. Youll also get excellent battery life, which is the second best reason to buy these headphones. Still, youre paying primarily for the incredible sound quality, which may not be enough for the high price.

Pros

Ridiculously good sound quality

Premium design and materials

Long battery life

Comfy fit

Cons

Very expensive

Limited features

Average ANC performance

Audio-Technica

Best wireless headphones under $100

Audio-Technica ATH-M20xBT

Noise cancellation: No | Multipoint: Yes | Battery life: 60 hours | Weight: 1.42 pounds | Water resistance: None | Assistant support: Not specified | Color options: Black, White

Audio-Technica has introduced affordable wireless headphones in the past, and while they didnt offer active noise cancellation, theyre still worth considering. The companys latest is the M20xBT, a Bluetooth version of the A-Ts popular M20x wired cans. For just $79, you can expect a comfortable fit and up to 60 hours of battery life. Bluetooth multipoint connectivity allows you to connect to multiple devices at once and physical buttons provide reliable on-board control. The design isnt as refined as the companys pricer models like the M50xBT2, but you get the bulk of what makes Audio-Technicas cheaper options so good.

Pros

Affordable

Up to 60 hours of battery life

Multipoint connectivity

Cons

Design isn't as refined as competitors'

Best noise-canceling wireless headphones

Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd gen)

Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Battery life: 30 hours | Water resistance: None | Assistant support: Google Assistant, Siri | Color options: Black, White, Desert Gold, Driftwood Sand, Midnight Violet

Read our full Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 review

The second-gen version of the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones arent an entirely new device, but there are impactful upgrades all around. With regard to the ANC specifically, Bose enhanced its ActiveSense tech to smooth any adjustments to sudden spikes in ambient noise levels. This bolsters what was already superb ANC performance, an achievement that gives the company a slight edge over the competition.

The new version also includes significant updates to power management and battery life, with at least five more hours of use in all listening modes. Youll also get lossless audio over USB-C, putting the QC Ultra Headphones on the same level at Apples AirPods Max and others. A comfy fit, reliable controls and folding design round out the spec sheet for this model.

Pros

Industry-leading ANC got even better

Sound and power upgrades are substantial

Cons

Still expensive

Glossy finish isnt for everyone

Technics

Best battery life on wireless headphones

Technics EAH-A800-K

Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Battery life: 50 hours | Weight: 0.65 pounds | Water resistance: None | Assistant support: Amazon Alexa | Color options: Black, Silver

Back at CES 2022, Panasonic announced the EAH-A800: a new set of active noise canceling headphones under the iconic Technics brand. While most of the features are what you see on any number of wireless headphones, one figure stood out. The company says you can expect up to 50 hours of battery life on the A800, and thats with active noise cancellation enabled. While we haven't put them through the full review analysis, I have already tested them on a long flight. The ANC is impressive and theyre comfortable enough to avoid becoming a burden after several hours or many long listening sessions. Sound quality is also quite good (theres LDAC support, too) and there are enough features here to justify the premium price tag.

Pros

50-hour battery life with ANC turned on

Comfortable design

Good sound quality

Cons

On the expensive side

MASTER & DYNAMIC

Best wireless headphones design

Master & Dynamic MW75

Noise cancellation: Yes | Multipoint: Yes | Battery life: 28 hours | Weight: 0.75 pounds | Water resistance: None | Assistant support: Compatible with native voice assistants | Color options: Silver Metal / Brown Leather, Black Metal / Black Leather, Silver Metal / Navy Leather, Silver Metal / Black Leather, Gunmetal / Black Leather, Gunmetal / Navy Leather, Silver Metal / Grey Leather

While Master & Dynamic is known for its design prowess, the companys over-ear headphones were due for a refresh. With the MW75 that debuted in June, the company opted for a look that takes cues from its MG20 gaming headphones and mixes them with a combo of aluminum, leather and tempered glass. The companys trademark sound quality returns with multiple ANC modes and ambient sound options for a range of situations. At $599, the high-end looks dont come cheap, but if youre looking for something beyond the pure plastic fashion of most headphones, M&D has you covered.

Pros

Luxurious design made with premium materials

Multiple ANC modes

Cons

Extremely expensive

How to choose the best wireless headphones for you

When it comes to shopping for a good pair of wireless headphones, the first thing youll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of our buyers guide, we focus on the over-ear style as thats what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear designs are much more effective at blocking sound. Speaking of noise cancellation, youll want to determine early on if you even want that. If you frequently crank up the beats in noisy environments, youll want to not only make sure its there, but also make sure its good, preferably with adaptive ANC. If you plan to use your new headphones in quieter spaces, skipping ANC can save you some money.

The next area to consider is features. We recommend trying to get the most bang for your buck, but as youre shopping around you should determine which items are must-haves and what you can live without. And dont take basic things like automatic pausing and Bluetooth multipoint connectivity for granted, as not all companies include them. We also suggest reading reviews to see how well a companys more advanced features work. This will help you decide if those are something youre willing to (likely) pay extra for. Keep an eye on better battery life estimates to avoid disappointment, as some manufacturers promise more hours than real-world testing delivers. And dont be easily swayed by lofty promises about call quality without verifying them.

Sound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. We understand this isnt easy at a time when were doing most of our shopping online. But trying on a set of headphones and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyers remorse. We also recommend paying attention to things like Spatial Audio, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all headphones support them, so youll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you. If you plan to use your headphones for other media besides music, checking for latency is also a must — some delay can impact playback for things like movies or games, even if most true wireless headphones now offer minimal lag.

How we test over-ear headphones

The primary way we test wireless headphones is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes dont allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, well typically power the headphones off several times and leave them during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps us from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.

To judge the best Bluetooth headphones, we focus on higher-quality audio by listening to a variety of genres and paying close attention to how each style sounds. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess the quality of phone calls, well record audio samples with the headphones microphones as well as have third parties call us.

When it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones were testing are an updated version of a previous model, well spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that we review.

Other wireless headphones we tested

AirPods Max

Apples AirPods Max are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancelation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.

Dyson On-Trac

The On-Trac headphones have an almost infinitely customizable design, and thats whats most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there arent any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor which is actually handy. All told, thats not a lot in a set of $500 headphones.

Sonos Ace

The Sonos Ace is an excellent debut for the companys first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.

Sony ULT Wear

If most headphones dont have the level of bass you desire, the ULT Wear is an option to consider. The low-end thump isnt for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.

Sony WH-CH720N

While the WH-CH720N are a great affordable option, we prefer the Audio-Technica in the budget category. Sonys cans are lightweight with good sound quality, but ANC struggles at times and theyre made with a lot of plastic.

Beats Studio Pro

The Studio Pro lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, theyre not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.

Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones

Boses latest flagship model has a lot to offer, but its trademark Immersive Audio feature can be inconsistent across different types of music. Theres still world-class ANC, excellent comfort and a clearer transparency mode, but for the price, the non-Ultra model is a better choice right now.

Master & Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)

The MH40 are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isnt overly tuned. This pair showcases the companys affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.

Bowers & Wilkins Px8

The companys trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the Px8 are more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S2.

Wireless headphones FAQs

How can you tell the quality of wireless headphones?

I typically look at three factors: design, sound quality and features. In terms of design, Im usually looking to see if the build quality of the headphones feels cheap and plasticky. Plenty of companies use plastic, but they can do so in a way that doesnt look or feel like budget models. For sound quality, I want to hear a nice, even tuning where highs, mids and lows are all well represented. No overly boomy bass or scooped out mids. I also want good clarity where you can pick up fine details and an open, immersive soundstage. Features is typically a distant third, but if a company doesnt cover basic functionality (automatic pausing, transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth, etc.) it can be an indication of overall quality.

How do I choose the best quality wireless headphones?

“Best” can be pretty subjective, but I always recommend going to a place where you can listen to the headphones youre thinking about buying before you commit. Sometimes this isnt possible, so youll want to check return policies. I also recommend doing some research to determine what your priorities are in a new set. Are you an audiophile who wants the best sound quality? Is powerful active noise cancellation (ANC) the most important? Would you rather have conveniences like automatic pausing?

Which brand has the best wireless headphones?

Sony consistently tops our list with its 1000X line. This is mostly due to the combination of sound quality, ANC performance and the truckload of features these headphones pack in. Ill be the first to tell you that there are better sounding options and other companies, like Bose, offer more effective noise cancellation. But when you add everything up, no one comes close to the full slate of tools Sony puts in its premium headphone line.

Do expensive wireless headphones sound better?

Exorbitant price tags dont mean better audio quality. Bowers & Wilkins headphones are on the high end for wireless noise-canceling models and they sound amazing. However, Audio-Technicas M50xBT2 is much more affordable and doesnt have ANC, but these headphones have a warm, natural sound profile that I find very inviting. At the end of the day, it will come down to personal preference, but you dont need to spend a lot to find great headphones.
