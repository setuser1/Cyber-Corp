It takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product — and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, theres a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade — with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, theyre placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industrys building capacity to its limit.

Below, weve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. Well keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.
