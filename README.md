While the U.S. government remains in limbo during a shutdown, the White House grounds have been busy this week. Construction workers have begun demolition on the White Houses East Wing, which will be replaced by a 90,000-square-foot ballroom thats estimated to hold up to 1,000 guests.

Taxpayers are not funding President Donald Trumps $250 million project. Rather, he is using private donations to construct his lavish addition to the White House.
