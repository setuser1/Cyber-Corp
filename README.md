Google Gemini is coming to GM vehicles in 2026. The company will be integrating a conversational AI assistant powered by Google's platform into many of its cars, trucks and SUVs.

GM says this assistant will be able to access vehicle data to suss out maintenance concerns, alerting the driver when necessary. The company also promises it'll be able to help plan routes and explain various features of the car. It should also be able to do stuff like turn on the heat or air conditioning, even before entering the vehicle.

This will replace the "Google built-in" operating system that already exists in many GM vehicles. This OS already offers access to stuff like Google Maps, Google Assistant and related apps. The upcoming Gemini-based chat assistant will do the same type of things, but it should perform better.

“One of the challenges with current voice assistants is that, if youve used the, youve probably also been frustrated by them because theyre trained on certain code words or they dont understand accents very well or if you dont say it quite right, you dont get the right response,” GM VP Dave Richardson told TechCrunch. “Whats great about large language models is they dont seem to be affected by that."

One brand-new feature that Gemini will bring to the table is web integration. This will let drivers ask the chatbot questions pertaining to geographic location and the like. GM gives an example of someone asking about the history of a bridge they are passing over.

The Gemini assistant will be available via the Play Store after launch as an over-the-air upgrade to Onstar-equipped vehicles. It won't be limited to newer releases, as GM says it'll work with vehicles from the model year 2015 and above. The company also says it's working on its own AI chatbot that has been "custom-built for your vehicle." There's no timetable on that one.

GM ran into hot water recently when it was found that it had been selling some customer information sourced from its OnStar Smart Driver program to insurance companies without user consent. This led to the FTC banning the company from selling any driver data for five years. Richardson says the Gemini integration will be privacy-focused and the software will let drivers control what information it can access and use.

The company made these announcements at the GM Forward media event, where it also discussed other forthcoming initiatives. It has scheduled a rollout of its self-driving platform for 2028. It's also developing its own computing platform, also launching in 2028. This does mean that GM will be sunsetting integration with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. This software will be phased out over the next few years.
