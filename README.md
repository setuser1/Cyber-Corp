It's that time of year when trick-or-treaters are finalizing their costumes and horror movie streaming service Shudder surely sees an uptick in usage. Yes, spooky season is upon us and Sony is getting in on the fun with its PlayStation Plus Game Catalog additions for October.

Starting on October 21, Extra and Premium subscribers will be able to play the remakes of Silent Hill 2 and Until Dawn on PS5 at no extra cost. Both games were released last October, so it hasn't taken too long for them to hit PS Plus. For extra spookiness, 2023's Alan Wake 2 is one of the games that all PS Plus members can claim this month, alongside Cocoon and Goat Simulator 3.

The other Game Catalog additions this time around are Yakuza: Like A Dragon (PS4 and PS5), As Dusk Falls (PS4, PS5), Poppy Playtime: Chapter 1 (PS4, PS5), Wizard with a Gun (PS5) and V Rising (PS5). Premium subscribers will also get a blast from the past in the shape of Tekken 3 (PS4, PS5), which debuted on the original PlayStation.
