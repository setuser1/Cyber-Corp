The US and Saudi Arabia have managed to derail negotiations regarding a landmark deal to cut global shipping emissions, according to a report by the BBC. The deal had already been approved and would have made shipping the world's first industry to adopt internationally mandated emissions guidelines.

Representatives from more than 100 countries had gathered in London to formally approve the so-called global carbon tax, after nearly ten years of negotiations. However, the US government had been pressuring countries to vote "no" on the measure, threatening tariffs if met with noncompliance.

The US also threatened other sanctions, including blocking vessels from ports and visa restrictions. President Trump has called it a "global green new scam." The country withdrew from talks back in April, just before the plan was approved.

Saudi Arabia instituted a plan to derail negotiations. The country tabled a motion to adjourn talks for a year, at a time when most countries were set to vote on it. That passed by just a handful of votes, with approving votes coming from both the US and Russia.

This essentially destroys the plan, despite technically being just a delay, as timelines will have to be renegotiated. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the outcome a "huge win" for Trump.

Even the shipping industry was on-board with the plan, as it offered consistent global standards that don't currently exist. Industries like certainty. Thomas Kazakos, secretary-general of the International Chamber of Shipping, said that the organization is "disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting." He also said that the "industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments."

Meanwhile, carbon dioxide levels reached record highs in 2024 and we aren't doing too much about it. This agreement would've forced ship owners to use cleaner fuels beginning in 2028, or face fines. Shipping currently makes up around three percent of global carbon emissions, but that's expected to rise by anywhere from ten percent to 150 percent by 2050.

Countries are expected to reconvene in April to discuss the plan, but this will likely not feature a vote. It'll likely be a renegotiation from the ground up.
