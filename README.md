Tucked away in Apple's announcement of a second-generation Vision Pro was news on the controller front. First, we already knew that, with visionOS 26, Apple's headset supports PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers. But now you can get them without Sony's headset.

The Apple Store will soon begin selling the PS VR2 Sense controllers for $250. (Cue spit take.) The $400 PS VR2 headset bundle was previously the only way to buy them new. Maybe when you can justify spending $3,499 on Apple's reality machine, $250 for the controllers is reasonable.

Apple says Sony's controllers open the door to more immersive gameplay on the Vision Pro. They support six degrees of freedom motion tracking (any direction you move or rotate), finger touch detection and rumble support.

Apple's second-gen Vision Pro is more powerful with the new M5 chip. It also includes a Dual Knit Band, which adds a top strap for increased stability and comfort. You'll be able to buy the PS VR2 Sense controllers from the Apple Store on November 11.
