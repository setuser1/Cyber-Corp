Reddit announced Thursday that it is expanding its AI-powered search experience to five new languages: French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese. With this expansion, the feature is now available in countries like Brazil, France, Germany, Spain, Mexico, and Italy.

Users who have set one of these languages as their default, instead of English, can now chat with the AI in question-and-answer format. Reddit uses a Google AI model to power the feature.
