On Thursday, Andreessen Horowitz released its first AI Spending Report in partnership with the fintech firm Mercury.  Using transaction data from Mercury, the report analyzes the top 50 AI-native application layer companies that startups are spending money on, similar to the previously published Top 100 Gen AI Consumer Apps.

A16z partners Olivia Mooe and Seema Amble say the data shows companies are still adopting a range of different AI products for certain tasks â€” and new apps are rising and falling very quickly.
